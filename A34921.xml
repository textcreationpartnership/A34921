            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>BEFORE (thou) enter into the Parlour, give me leave to ſalute thee with a few words in this Porch. There are two Books which deſervedly call for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious peruſal, both of Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Teachers, and thoſe who are taught: Thoſe Books are, the Two Volumes of the Sacred Scriptures, and Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: And theſe are Comments on, or Expoſitions of each other. I grant the former to be determinative, and yet the later I adjudg to be inductive to, and ſo harmoniouſly illuſtrative of the former. The Moon hath its light for the uſe of man, though the light thereof be borrowed from the Sun in part, as ſay the Learned. <hi>Divine Providence</hi> is a Torch ſet up in the World, and is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame fire, <hi>viz.</hi> The Will of God, with the Scriptures: A difference
<pb facs="tcp:101303:3"/> there is, and yet not ſuch, but that both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> do concenter in the glory of God, the uſe of man, and the mutual elucidation of each other.</p>
            <p>I have in the following Treatiſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to preſent thee with a Draught or Picture of <hi>Divine Providence;</hi> and have caſt my weak eye on the Sacred Scriptures in drawing this Picture. I look on the holy Scriptures, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and lively Face, and whoſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects them, will do the work by halves, as it is vulgarly phraſed. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; in the proſecution of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I have (or at leaſt-wiſe would have) conſulted three things.</p>
            <p>1. A pertinent Variety, for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and this as founded on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and amplified from ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix't Hiſtories, ſome whereof are found on record in Authors; others are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed by me: and though I have not ſo particularly ſet them down for Time, Place, and Perſons; yet they are no Fictions, but Realities, commended to me from thoſe who would not tell a lye for <hi>Providence.</hi> Far be it from me to affect lying-Legends; and as far be it from me (becauſe of lying-Legends
<pb facs="tcp:101303:3"/> in the World) to bury the Works of God in the grave of a contemptuous Oblivion! Extreams in matters, are of dangerous conſequence. An holy Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence teacheth to beware, leſt whilſt we eſſay to run from ſin, we do not run into ſin. And thus for the firſt thing here conſulted.</p>
            <p>2. A Clearneſs for Method. That Method pleaſeth me, which may be moſt uſeful for the common Reader, whoſe good is intended in the Subject to be treated of. I like not that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of ſome, who will not travel the eaſieſt and plaineſt Road, becauſe of the company of ſuch who indeed are honeſt and plain men, and will commit no robbery, unleſs it be on the luſts of men, by a facil acceſs to their ſouls in the way of Teaching; and let ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Robbers be forgiven this wrong. Here, if I miſtake not, I have kept pace with that Method which not only the common <hi>Reader</hi>'s capacity may admit of; but the Subject here handled doth in a ſort reſolve it ſelf into. It matters not by what appellation this Method is termed, ſo it be ſuitable to the nature of the ſubject, and the Reader's capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. If any liſt to be contentious, I
<pb facs="tcp:101303:4"/> ſay no more, but, That we have no ſuch cuſtom in our Countrey to cavil about the colour of a Cow which gives down her Milk with eaſe, and that too good for ſuch who ſcorn it becauſe of the mixt colour of the Beaſt. And thus for the Method here.</p>
            <p>3. An ordinary Plainneſs for the Phraſe or Language. I affect not high and long lines; but rather ſhort Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and plain Similitudes. The one beſt ſuits with a weak memory, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a low underſtanding. Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, or popular Alluſions, have a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage; for as they are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from things in and about which <hi>Providence</hi> doth work, ſo they bring to remembrance the Works of <hi>Providence.</hi> The Water of Life may be called to mind at a <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well. If the phraſe then here uſed run not ſmoothly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I ſtudy Things, not Words. A Diamond, though not poliſh't, is not to be thrown by, as a peeble-ſtone.</p>
            <p>If in the reading thou object, (1.) That ſome places of Scripute are more than once mentioned. (2.) That the ſame matter is in ſome places of this Treatiſe repeated. I muſt crave thy patience to hear, before thou condem. And to the
<pb facs="tcp:101303:4"/> firſt of theſe take the Reply as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>1. The ſame places of Scripture may be quoted, and yet the ſame Scriptures not needleſly repeated. One and the ſame place of Scripture hath divers things wrapt up in it. There are more Jewels than one in the Casket. If one be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out at one time, another at another ſeaſon, thou muſt blame thine own eyes in looking meerly on the Casket, and not on the diſtinct Jewel.</p>
            <p>2. Though the ſame Scriptures may be repeated, yet thou may'ſt find them perhaps ſo repeated, as may wipe off the calumny of a vain repetition. It is well obſerved by one in reference to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s <hi>Proverbs, That though the ſame Proverb be here and there ſcatter'd, yet we have it with intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſecond Objection, conſider the following Reply. (1.) Diſtinguiſh between the material, and formal or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe conſideration of a thing. An old Truth may be found a new one; new, in regard of the Principle from which it is deducted; and old, for that the ſame, for the matter, was before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. The Doctrine of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a Truth known from divers
<pb facs="tcp:101303:5"/> places of Scripture; but this, as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally infer'd by our Saviour from <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6. may well be-ſpeak the funerals of fooliſh cavils, and the reſurrection of an holy admiration. But (2.) if this ſuffice not, remember, the Writer may be forgetful as well as others. I could mention worthy Authors, in whoſe Writings ſome things occur once and again. I attribute this not to their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, but forgetfulneſs, and loathneſs to diſſever the Links of the Chain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined in a friendly neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Have charity then in this caſe, if not for others, yet for thy ſelf: for it may be the ſame thing that may occur, is willing to confer a-freſh with thy ſoul, being not ſo fully underſtood, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically improved by thee, as it ſhould be, <hi>To write the ſame things to you, to me indeed is not grievous; but for you it is ſafe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> chap. 3. 1.</p>
            <p>Having thus far been thy Guide, leſt thou may'ſt loſe thy way; it's time now to leave thee to thy journey. I hope thou wilt not meet with mire and dirt here. What is ſo, if any, I muſt own: what is not ſo, <hi>Providence</hi> will own. I muſt confeſs, the Subject may call for a
<pb facs="tcp:101303:5"/> Quill pluck't from the wing of a <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim;</hi> and though that be ſo, yet that is no apology to have Padlocks on our Tongues or Pens: for the Tongue ought to be the Pen of a ready writer; and the Pen the Tongue of a ready ſpeaker, to publiſh the <hi>wonderful works of him who is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee: to whom be honour and power everlaſting, Amen.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 15, 16.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE word [<hi>Providence</hi>] hath its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious imports or ſignifications; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken in a bad ſenſe, and ſo notes an unhappy fore-caſt or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in order to men's gratifying ſome luſt or other: ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>But put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> Sinners are provident for their darling-corruptions; <hi>They are wiſe to do evil; but to do good they have no knowledg,</hi> Jer. 4. 22.</p>
            <p>2. Other-while the word is taken in a good ſenſe; and ſo it is applied or accommodated, (1.) To men. (2.) To God.</p>
            <p>1. As it is applied to men; it notes or points at a Moral Virtue, a Political Endowment, and a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Grace. A prudent man in ordering his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, is all one with the <hi>provident</hi> man. <hi>Paulus Sergius</hi> is ſtil'd a <hi>prudent man,</hi> Acts 13. 7. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> in his Oration doth politically uſe, if not through flattery abuſe, the term [<hi>Providence</hi>]. <hi>Very worthy deeds are done unto this Nation by thy Providence,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. 2. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth call for the exerciſe of Pre-conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Prudence, or Providence, as a Theological Virtue or Grace to be made conſcience of by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb facs="tcp:101303:7"/> Rom. 12. 17. <hi>Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>But if any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> And thus, as the word is applied to men.</p>
            <p>2. The term is transferr'd to God; and ſo it is,</p>
            <p>1. Decretal, Original, Ordinative, and is nothing elſe but the eternal Platform of things, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Draught or Copy of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28.</p>
            <p>2. Actual or Executive, which is the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane or Copy of that Copy, and notes more than a meer inſpection or looking thorow the wood or buſhes of Second Cauſes and Contingent Events. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s belief doth note more than a meer inſight, when he ſaith to <hi>Iſaac, God will</hi> provide <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Lamb for a burnt-offering,</hi> Gen, 22. 8. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording therefore to this later acceptation of the word, I may thus deſcribe it, as the deſcription is founded on the Sacred Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Providence is a work of God, whereby he ſuſtains, governs, orders, all the Creatures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of his will, to his own glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a work</hi>] As there are the works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo there are the works of Providence. It is ſaid <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. <hi>His work is perfect.</hi> And Pſal. 44. 1. <hi>We have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what work thou didſt in their days, in the times of old.</hi> So Pſal. 77. 12. <hi>I will meditate alſo of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</hi> And Iſa. 28. 21. <hi>That he may do his work, his ſtrange work, and bring to paſs his act, his</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101303:7"/>

                  <hi>Micaiah.</hi> In the firſt Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> there is a Providential ſcheme or draught of what was to take place in <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe there. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>'s Viſion of the Wheels, is a confutation of the <hi>Wheel of Fortune.</hi> They who know God, have the <hi>Wheel of Providence</hi> to meditate and diſcourſe of.</p>
               <p>2. From poſitive Aſſertions in Scripture: <hi>The Lord looketh from heaven, he beholdeth all the ſons of men: from the place of his habitation, he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth: he faſhioneth their hearts alike; he conſidereth all their works,</hi> Pſal. 33. 13, 14, 15. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. 15. 3. <hi>Behold the fowls of the air, for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns: yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not better than they?</hi> Mat. 26. See alſo Mat. 10. 29.</p>
               <p>3. From Divine Aſſumptions and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations of the work of Providence to God himſelf. When the Lord anſwered <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirl-wind, how doth he challenge to himſelf a ſupream Agency in and over the Creatures? <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>provideth for the Raven his food?</hi> Job 38. 41. And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. From Expoſtulations, Checks, Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, bottomed on the conſideration of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence: thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf: but I</hi>

               <p>5. From the Religious forms of ſpeech: by which are implied the verity of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> extending to affairs in the world. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, As yet they ſhall uſe this ſpeech in the land of Judah, and in the Cities thereof, when I ſhall being again their captivity, The Lord bleſs thee, O habitation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Mountain of Holineſs,</hi> Jer. 31. 23. <hi>For that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this or that,</hi> James 4. 15. <hi>I truſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to tarry a while with you, if the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 7.</p>
               <p>6. From Prayers made to God. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath no Altar for an unknown God. We are not taught to pray to Fortune, to our own Wills, Saints or Angels: None of theſe are the <hi>Father which is in Heaven,</hi> whoſe <hi>is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory.</hi> The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Prayers of Saints, are demonſtrations that they were not Heterodox in the point of <hi>Providence;</hi> they acknowledged a <hi>Providence</hi> on earth, who were ever and anon looking up in prayer to the God of Heaven. See <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21, 22, 31. <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 4, with 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 10.</p>

                  <p>1. FRom God himſelf: And ſo obſerve, 1. That the appellations or titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Him, are implications of the thing. He is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who gives the Creatures their beeing and operation, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. He is <hi>the Judg of all the earth,</hi> Gen. 18. 25. He is <hi>the King of all the earth,</hi> Pſal. 47. 7. He is the Firſt Cauſe; <hi>I will hear the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the heavens ſhall hear the earth,</hi> &amp;c.

                     </note> To deny then his Providence, is to take up the Bucklers againſt theſe no leſs glorious, than true Appellations of his. But, 2. His glorious Attributes of Power, Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Juſtice, are as ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his <hi>Providence:</hi> for all theſe, the World exiſting, are not dormant: Theſe Attributes are richly interwoven in the works of <hi>Providence.</hi> The Scripture ſaith unto <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101303:10"/> 
                     <hi>Even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name might be declared throughout all the earth.</hi> Rom. 8. 17. <hi>Thou art good, and doſt good.</hi> Pſal. 119. 68. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom haſt thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</hi> Pſal 104. 24. <hi>But God is the Judg; he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> Pſal. 75. 7. Laſtly, The Lord's creation of the World doth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Logick of the Scripture, infer his <hi>Providence:</hi> For, 1. He is called, <hi>the faithful Creator,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 19. The Lord leaves not the ſtately Houſe of the World, after he hath erected it. 2. Conſiderations or Motives for ſupportation and conſolation, are couch'd in God's creation of the World: ſo that they who have an intereſt in God, may hope for a diſplay of his Attributes in his government of the World: ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. <hi>Haſt thou not known, haſt thou not heard, That the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is he weary?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. 3. There is an indiſſoluble or firm knot knit betwixt the Lord's creating and governing the World: for, what is <hi>Providence</hi> but a kind of continued Creation? and therefore that word is uſed to ſet forth <hi>Providence</hi> by in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. and 104. 30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 7. Again, to acknowledg God the Creator, and ſome other the Governour, is, to rob the Lord of his glory; againſt which robbery he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently proteſteth, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 8. Laſtly, obſerve, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. the ſame God there, who

There is no reaſon then to break the band of amity or alliance betwixt Creation and Providence, which the Lord ſo conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively owneth and appropriateth to himſelf, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>2. From Providence it ſelf. There is an intrinſecal or inbred light in Providence, by which it is ſeen. <hi>But ask now the beaſts, and they ſhall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they ſhall tell thee: or ſpeak to the earth, and it ſhall teach thee, and the fiſhes of the ſea ſhall declare unto thee; Who knoweth not in all theſe, the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?</hi> Job 12. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>There are four things obſervable; the firſt whereof is general; the other three more ſpecial: but all of them corroborate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the teſtimony of Providence. That which is general, is the admirable and wiſe diſpoſition of things. The Creatures know their ranks and files; ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. <hi>The day is thine, the night alſo is thine; thou haſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the light and the ſun: thou haſt ſet all the borders of the earth: thou haſt made ſummer and winter,</hi> v. 16, 17. <note place="margin">Simul etiam à facili argumentatur: Cum talia praeſtes quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, quanto facilius potes nos liberare? <hi>Molleras in loc.</hi>
                     </note> Note here, how the words do not only declare an exact and conſtituted order in naturals; but do likewiſe imply a rich diſplay of Wiſdom, in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes and ſucceſſions of diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and deliverances, which are wiſely timed by the Providence of God for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101303:11"/> his people. And to this purpoſe tends the ſcope of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>The things <hi>ſpecial</hi> in the Providence of God, are, 1. The tranſcendency or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary viſibility of it in ſome matters. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence oftentimes mounts aloft above the reaſon of ſecond Cauſes. Thus the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when they ſaw the Earthquake, and what was done, <hi>they feared greatly, ſaying, Truly this was the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 27. 54. 2. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful adaequateneſs and proportion of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation. An inſtance for this is that in <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 6, 7. <hi>As I have done</hi> (ſaith <hi>Adonibezek</hi> there) <hi>ſo God hath requited me.</hi> 3.

So the raiſing up of <hi>Cyrus, Ezek.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3, 4. compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 28. and 45. 13. And ſo likewiſe the <hi>Jews</hi> under their calamities might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the convincing-hand of Providence; when their language is, <hi>Like as the Lord of Hoſts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings; ſo hath he dealt with us,</hi> Zech. 1. 6. And not only the cruſhing-diſpenſations by the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in conjunction with the threatnings of the Prophets, carry the more of a conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <q rend="inline">At the ſame time <hi>Daniel</hi> wrote as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Empire of the <hi>Romans,</hi> how it ſhould deſtroy our Nation; and hath left all theſe things in writing, according as God declared unto him; ſo that they who read and conſider thoſe things that have happened, admire <hi>Daniel</hi> for the honour God hath dignified him with; and find thereby that <hi>Epicures</hi> err, who drive all Providence from human life, and affirm, That God governeth not the affairs of the World; or, that the World is adminiſtred by an happy and incorruptible eſſence, which cauſeth all things to continue in their beeing: but ſay, that the World is managed by it ſelf, by Caſualty, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor, or ſuch an one as hath care thereof: for if it were ſo, and that it were deſtitute of a Soveraign Governour (as we ſee Ships deſtitute of their Pilots, to be drowned by the Winds; and Chariots, that have no Drivers to conduct them, to beat one againſt another; even ſo ſhould it ruinate it ſelf). By theſe things therefore that <hi>Daniel</hi> hath foretold, I judg, that they are far eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the truth, that affirm, That God hath no care of human affairs: for it we ſee that all things happen caſually, then happen they not according to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. From the Abſurdities on the contrary. 1. The World, in regard of the comely oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy or adminiſtration of it, which takes place, would not be a World, whilſt it is a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101303:12"/> World: for if there are evil Angels, and theſe ſo malicious and miſchievous as the word of God affirmeth; theſe would marr the beauty of all, and turn all into heaps of confuſion, were there not a curbing-Providence, as is fully declared from <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 1 and 2. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 31, 32. In both which places men may behold <hi>Beelzebub</hi> with his Companions in the Chains of Providence.</p>
                  <p>2. The Checks of conſcience, and fears on the ſpirits of men, would be but a falſe fire, and groundleſs fancy, if there were not a Providence; and this is contrary to that of the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. where he ſpeaks of an accuſing and terrifying Conſcience in the Heathens, who ſtood in ſome awe of a Deity, or a Providence controlling them and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for their miſ-deeds. The barbarous people of <hi>Melita</hi> had an obſervation of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance purſuing Murder, as may be collected from <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 24.</p>
                  <p>3.

                  <p>THough the Doctrine of <hi>Providence</hi> be written with a Sun-beam, yet there are ſome miſts and fogs, by reaſon whereof, ſome are at a puzzle, and ready to queſtion the truth of God's Providence.</p>
                  <p>The great and common Objection is, The ſeeming confuſion in the World by reaſon of the fury and tyranny of ſome wicked ones, who proſper in their attempts on others, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themſelves; and not only Heathens of the wild Common of the World, but others of the encloſed Garden of the Lord, have hereupon been ſtaggered; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.</p>

                  <p>1. Whatever there is of proper ataxie, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, or confuſion, is not to be charged on the Lord, who <hi>is not the author of confuſion,</hi> 1 Cor. 14 33.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a wiſe and righteous method of God in all the diſorders and confuſions of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101303:13"/> men. <hi>Providence</hi> is in the head of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, obſerving a goodly order, when the Creatures to our apprehenſion keep neither rank nor file. A ſerious ſearch then being made into the diſorders and barbarous inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of men, it will be ſo far from diſmant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Throne of <hi>Providence,</hi> as that it will clear up the eye of faith, to behold the Lord ſitting there, and ſceptring it over the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt outragious Monarchs of the World. <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a throne,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 1. and yet in the ſame Chapter we read how Cities were to be waſted, without an Inhabitant, and the houſes without men, and the Land to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, <hi>v.</hi> 11. The ſame Prophet hath a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Treatiſe on this ſubject, in the tenth Chapter, where indeed the Prophet plays the Caſuiſt, and giveth ſatisfaction to the doubt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> ch. 10.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome other Objections, which the weakneſs or perverſneſs of man doth ſtart from places of Scripture: I ſhall name them, and ſo reply.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From that paſſage of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 14. <hi>Let us now fall into the hand of the Lord; and let me not fall into the hand of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The meaning of <hi>David</hi> is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>Providence</hi> of God as reaching to the Swords and Spears of an Enemy; he had not ſo learned <hi>Providence:</hi> for he who was a man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101303:14"/> of warr, was alſo a pious Soldier, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God's Providence in the field. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 62.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſenſe then muſt be otherwiſe; and that either, 1. By way of a comparative oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between the righteous and eminent hand of God in the Peſtilence, (as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16.) and the wicked hands of men, who will, with their victories, inſult over Religion, and blaſpheme God with their tongues, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account cut deeper on the tender Conſciences of Saints, than Swords and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-axes do on their fleſh. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 18. and 137. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 1, 14, 15, with 23, 24. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording then to this interpretation, <hi>David</hi> may be underſtood: and if not ſo, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; then, 2. By way of popular alluſion: <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks after the manner of men, as <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 31. or as a Child, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving incurr'd his Father's diſpleaſure, is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be corrected by his Father, and not to be turn'd over to ſome baſe Slave for corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and the rather he deſires this, becauſe he hath to do with a Father. After this ſort, <hi>David</hi>'s phraſe of ſpeech may be underſtood; and that, 1. Becauſe he renders this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for his choice, <hi>For very great are his mercies,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 13. 2. Becauſe in other places of Scripture God is ſet forth as a Father, whoſe bowels turn whilſt the rod is in his hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13. with <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8.</p>
                  <p>Another place of Scripture is <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>For I was but a little diſpleaſed, and they helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the affiiction.</hi>

This (ſaith a modern Divine) made God as angry with thoſe he ſet a-work, as them againſt whom they were employed: So hateful is cruelty and ambition to him, and ſo different is his mind and man's in inflicting the ſame puniſhment.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not deny the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> with reſpect to Oxen; (for that is plainly aſſerted in Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114. 14.) but his purpoſe is to back the Doctrine of Miniſterial maintenance from thence; and that, as myſtically or typically held forth by the labouring-Oxe, who had the priviledg to be without a muzzle; or rather by arguing <hi>à fortiori,</hi> thus: <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> he doth: and therefore, if the Lord would have equity obſerved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the labouring-beaſt, much more ſhould they, who labour in the Lord, have their double honour. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18. The Lord values a good Miniſter more than Oxen; though ſome men, worſe than Beaſts, value their Oxen more than their Miniſter.

                  <p>Again, <hi>Providence</hi> is (1.) ordinary, which keeps the uſual road or inſtituted order both in naturals and ſpirituals: See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 4, 5. 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 35, 36, 37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
                  <p>2. Extraordinary, which is oppoſite to the former, as <hi>John</hi> 10. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Here if I might (though I affect not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Divinity) I would diſtinguiſh <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Providence</hi> into that which is (1) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and properly miraculous. (2.) Eminently and remarkably wondrous. I may ſet forth this by an alluſive Inſtance: For a Child to throw a ſtrong Man to the ground, and that by grappling with him hand to hand, may well be interpreted miraculous; there being no proportion of ſtrength in the Child to that of a Mighty man. And yet ſuppoſe the man is ſitting according to a tottering poſture in a Chair, ſo that his body is in equal po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ze, a ſmall puſh of a child ſends him head-long to the ground. In like manner <hi>Providence,</hi> by a wonderful conjunction of weak means in themſelves, and by opportune application of means, brings forth a work very glorious. See <hi>Judges</hi> 4. 21. and 7. 16, 17, 18. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 23, 24.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101303:19"/> when the Lord himſelf preached to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Moſes</hi> lives, but not by the uſe of the creatures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 28.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Mediate,</hi> when the Lord uſeth means, (1.) more common or general, as the Angels for their miniſtry; the Heavens and the Earth for Corn, Wine, and Oyl. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 21, 22. (2.) More peculiar, and particularly deſtinated for ſuch ends and purpoſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 5, 6. the Angel will not there take away <hi>Peter</hi>'s work; he willeth <hi>Cornelius</hi> to ſend for <hi>Simon Peter</hi> (not <hi>Simon</hi> the Tanner) for his Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Means in order to Effects and Conſequents, are,</p>
                  <p>1. Neceſſary, or definite; which ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work this way, and no other; as, for the Sun to ſhine and give forth heat, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>2. Contingent and indefinite; whoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, before they exiſt, might not ſo have been, as conſidered with their next Cauſes; though otherwiſe in reſpect of God, his will to the contrary, the ſaid effects are neceſſary; So the bones of Chriſt were not broken, <hi>John</hi> 19. 31, 32, 33, with 36.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PROVIDENCE,</hi> in regard of the End, Iſſues, and Events, hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
                  <p>1. The End is ultimate, or laſt; and that is the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32, 33, 36. or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate, which is the creatures ſerviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uſefulneſs, according to its place or ſtation, in order to the former. So the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth are Caterers for <hi>Jezreel,</hi> and that to the Lord's glory, whoſe bounty and mercy are diſplayed in hearing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth for <hi>Jezreel,</hi> Hoſ. 2. ver. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Iſſues of <hi>Providence</hi> reſpecting matters, are ſometimes by way of furthering and ſucceeding things, ſo that the ordinary particular End is attained: ſo when God heareth the Heavens, the Heavens the Earth, the Earth the Corn, and the Wine and Oyl, and they hear <hi>Jezreel, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Or, ſecondly, By way of daſhing things, notwithſtanding a probability of ſuch and ſuch Ends, though not of ſuch Ends as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> intendeth, where and when the Lord croſſeth, diſappointeth, or thus daſheth in his Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Laſtly, The Events of <hi>Providence</hi> are,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Joyful;</hi> which terminate in the good,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101303:20"/> comfort, happineſs of the Creature, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 30, 31. <hi>Eſth.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
                  <p>Or, ſecondly, <hi>Mournful;</hi> or by way of ſmart, diſtreſs, tribulation; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 27, 28. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have marſhall'd up the ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions or Conſiderations of <hi>Providence:</hi> There are other ſubordinate Conſiderations of it, yet reducible to ſome of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Heads of Diſtinction or Conſideration. What thoſe other Conſiderations are, I may only point at.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Providence</hi> then may be conſidered as <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>collateral:</hi> An inſtance for the former, is the Lord's ſtirring up <hi>Cyrus</hi> in order to the delivery of his people, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. An illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the later, may be the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> invading the Land; which (at leaſt in regard of any ſuch thing intended by them) was a by-blow for <hi>David</hi>'s deliverance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Providence</hi> may be conſidered as more <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious,</hi> ſo that he who runs may read; or more <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>intricate.</hi> Moreover, It may be conſidered as <hi>ſingle</hi> or <hi>in part;</hi> and as <hi>copulative,</hi> as when the whole of a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is laid together.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It may be conſidered, as <hi>concealing for a time;</hi> or <hi>revealing, bringing things to light.</hi> Theſe and the like Conſiderations being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the following pages, I forbear en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement here, and ſo paſs on to the Third Part of the Treatiſe.</p>

                  <p>THE proof for the Extent of <hi>Providence,</hi> appeareth divers ways, as here briefly to be inſiſted on, followeth.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101303:21"/>
                  <p>1. From expreſs aſſertions in Scripture: The aſſertions have their latitude; they know no bounds of mans reſtriction: ſo <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Thou even thou art Lord alone; thou haſt made heaven, the heaven of heavens with all their hoſt, the earth and all things therein; and thou preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them all, and the hoſt of heaven worſhippeth thee,</hi> ſay that godly company there on their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Day of Humiliation, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 4.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, what the Lord himſelf aſſerteth to this purpoſe in the 38, 39, 40, 41 chapters of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. From God; without whoſe will, and againſt whoſe will (the will of Purpoſe; nor of Precept, diſcovered in his Law-giving Rules for man), nothing comes to paſs. <hi>Are not two ſparrows</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſold for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Father,</hi> Mat. 10. 29. <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs, when the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> Lam. 3. 37.</p>
                  <p>3. From the Creatures; which becauſe they are Creatures, are not independent, or exempted in point of dependency, from the firſt Cauſe. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>wait all upon thee, that thou mayſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 104. 27. See further other places of Scripture, which are quoted upon other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular accounts, though upon the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Providence</hi> they are repeated, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 21, 22. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101303:22"/>
                  <p>4. From the cognation or kinſhip of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     </hi>dence with <hi>Creation, Providence</hi> (as was before intimated) is a kind of continued Creation. God not only gives the creatures their beds to lye on, but (bear with the phraſe) makes their beds. As Creation therefore is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the creatures without exception, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 25. ſo likewiſe is the Lord's upholding them and governing them to his own glory. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>FIRST then, from the Doctrine of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal extent of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Providence,</hi> it may be evinced, That vain and falſe is the conceit of thoſe, who though they allow a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> yet narrow it in regard of the Object; as if ſo be <hi>Providence</hi> reached to ſome of the more noble of the creatures, and not to others. Whatever the Philoſophy, or rather the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy of Philoſophy, dictates, true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity leſſoneth otherwiſe. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in the heaven, and in the earth; in the ſeas, and in all deep places,</hi> Pſal. 135. 6.<note place="margin">Nam ex creatione colligit Deum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualiter moderari quicquid in coelo &amp; terrâ agitur: quia abſurdum eſſet, coelos à Deo creatos fortuitò nunc volvi; &amp; res vel hominum arbitrio, vel temere &amp; caſu miſceri in terrâ; quia proprium Dei eſt tueri &amp; gubernare quicquid condidit: Ne cum profanis hominibus imaginemur pulcherrimi hujus theatri conſpectu otioſum frui. <hi>Calv.</hi> ad locum.</note>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101303:22"/>
                  <p>In the ſecond place then; Here is a large field for contemplation of, and meditation on, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. <hi>Providence,</hi> which reacheth to all things, teacheth man to eye God in every thing, and to beware of ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in any thing. There are five tracks or paths of <hi>Providence</hi> which here I ſhall point out at, and ſo encourage the Chriſtian to ſet foot in them for his good and benefit.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, the path which <hi>Providence</hi> beats out through the heads and hearts of men, in Civils as well as Sacreds.</p>
                  <p>2. The cleanly way of <hi>Providence</hi> through the dirt and mire of men's ſins.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſtraight road of <hi>Providence,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many lanes, windings, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of contingencies.</p>
                  <p>4. The Church-yard-way, or the ſable walk of <hi>Providence</hi> to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or the place of skulls:</p>
                  <p>5. That leſſer, trivial, and ſcarce a way of <hi>Providence</hi> (to carnal reaſon) in matters of ſmaller moment.</p>
                  <p>All theſe I may well call the beaten paths of <hi>Providence.</hi> I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould not eye the Almighty in theſe paths. Be not therefore (O Chriſtian) at a ſtand here, as they were at the place where <hi>Aſahel</hi> fell down, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 23. Here is no bloody <hi>Aſahel;</hi> I mean, no ſuch black and bloody notions in aſſerting the walk of the Lord in theſe paths.</p>

                     <head>SECT. 1.</head>
                     <p>That the <hi>Providence</hi> of God reacheth to the Wills of men, is queſtioned by ſome; but truly aſſerted by others, and that according to the ſacred Scriptures: For,</p>
                     <p>1. They who ſeem to be moſt arbitrary in the world, are yet aſſerted to be in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Providence:</hi> the Great-ones of the World owe homage to the Great Lord of the World; though they are Lords of men, yet not of <hi>Providence. Solomon,</hi> who ſaith of a King, <hi>He doth whatſoever pleaſeth him,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 3. ſaith alſo, <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water; he turneth it whitherſoever he will,</hi> Prov. 21. 1. Chriſt aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to <hi>Pilate</hi>'s face, ſaying, <hi>Thou couldſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above,</hi> John 19. 11.</p>
                     <p>2. The reaſon why men take this or that courſe, is in ſome reſpect attributed to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, as over-ruling. <hi>Sampſon</hi> is for a Timnah-Damoſel; his Parents knew that <hi>it was of the Lord, that he ſought an occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Philiſtines,</hi> Judg. 14. 4. <hi>Saul went home to Gilead, and there went with him a band of men whoſe hearts God had touched,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 26. See more 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 5, 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>3. The Prayers of Saints do imply the truth of this aſſertion. <hi>God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may ſend away your other brother, and Benjamin,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi> to his ſons, who were now ſetting forward to <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101303:23"/> 43. 14. See alſo <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 4. with the following verſes, which give to underſtand <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s belief in this point; and ſo likewiſe that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>4. There are clear inſtances of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, winding and turning the hearts of men, and that contrary to their natural byaſs and probable inducements which might ſway them another way. <hi>Laban</hi> lays not violent hands on <hi>Jacob,</hi> though covetouſneſs and fury might edg him on ſo to do. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 7. 29. <hi>Eſau</hi> had an inveterate hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jacob;</hi> and howbeit he is kind and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 4. The Lord gave the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> favour in the ſight of the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 12. 36. <hi>Cyrus</hi> let go the captives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price and reward, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 13.</p>
                     <p>5. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God is converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſenſes of men. <hi>The hearing-ear and the ſeeing-eye, the Lord hath made even both of them,</hi> Prov. 20. 12. Notable inſtances there are of the marvellous extent of <hi>Providence</hi> to the eyes and ears of men! Witneſs the <hi>Sodomites</hi> blindneſs, or want of diſcerning <hi>Lot</hi>'s dore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 11. The <hi>Syrians</hi> were led in a dance by the Prophet to <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 Kings 6. 18. In like ſort the Lord is ſaid to make the Hoſt of the <hi>Syrians</hi> to hear a noiſe of Chariots, and a noiſe of Horſes, even the noiſe of a great Hoſt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 6. Now <hi>Providence,</hi> which thus walketh in the Porch of men's ſenſes, walks from thence into the Parlour of the nobler faculties of men's Underſtandings, Wills, Affections. There is a natural inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101303:24"/> betwixt this lower and upper houſe of man. Reaſon not only takes a true, but even a falſe alarum of the Senſes, as in the place laſt mentioned; <hi>The King of Iſrael</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Syrians</hi> one unto another) <hi>hath hired againſt us the Kings of the Hittites, and the Kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us: wherefore they aroſe and fled,</hi> 2 Kings 7. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>6. The conſiderable revolutions, changes, iſſues of matters in the World, turn in, and turn out at the doors of men's hearts. What is ſtated and accorded at this Council-board, hath a conſiderable influx on the affairs of Nations and Kingdoms. <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> his heart is towards <hi>Eſther,</hi> chap. 5. 3. and 7. 3, 4. and what a change follows both in Court and Countrey, after, the following Hiſtory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. Let a <hi>Darius</hi> be partially won to own <hi>Daniel</hi>'s God, and what a change is there in his Dominions? <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 26, 27. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> is reſolved on a Tax, and what an influence hath that throughout the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire? <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Objections to the contrary, namely, That <hi>Providence</hi> doth not thus reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of men; have no weight in them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It's objected, Where is then man's liberty?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Where is, on the other hand, the Lord's Prerogative-Royal over all men, and all of men? Is not the Lord, King of kings, and Lord of lords? Hath not he the ſupream
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101303:24"/> Agency in and over the hearts of men? Do not men think, adviſe, determine thus and thus? and yet <hi>the anſwer of the tongue is from the Lord,</hi> ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1.</p>
                     <p>2. Let the Objectors reconcile man's liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the fore-knowledg of God (which is not denied); and the like reconciliation may be found with the Will and Providence of God. Look at what door the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God goes out at, without a juſtle at the wills of men: at the ſame door the Will and Providence of the All-wiſe God can and do go forth.</p>
                     <p>3. The Scripture hath plain and full inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of accord betwixt man's liberty and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence. Saul</hi> acted freely in ſeeking his Father's Aſſes; and yet the Lord had told <hi>Samuel</hi> before, <hi>I will ſend thee a man out of the land of Benjamin,</hi> 1 Sam. 9. 16. The King of <hi>Babylon</hi> reſolveth, and that freely (having uſed his divination), to go againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and this holds correſpondence with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God by the Prophet, againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 21. 18.</p>
                     <p>4. Man therefore acts freely, becauſe God hath conſtituted in him a freedom from coaction and brutiſh determination. The Lord hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſht the foul of man with the noble faculties of Reaſon, and Election, ſo as that he differs from a Beaſt; and hath a liberty in acting, though not a liberty of abſolute independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He who learns to ſwim, puts forth his hands and feet freely, though another hold and guide his head. And this may ſerve
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101303:25"/> by way of reply to that firſt Objection.</p>
                     <p>2. It may be asked by ſome, Would not this Doctrine make God the Author of ſin?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Would not a denial of God's <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> about the Wills of men, make them the Authors of Grace? Surely ſuch Doctrine which robbeth the Lord of his glory in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, changing, and renewing the hearts of men, is not of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                     <p>2. It may be replied then to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with that of the Apoſtle to the like; <hi>God forbid; for then how ſhall God judg the world?</hi> Rom. 3. 6. The holy God, who made the houſe of man's ſoul, and the ſeveral rooms thereof, knows all the naſty corners of the ſinner, and can go in and out in his <hi>Providence,</hi> without defiling the garment of his Holineſs. The Sun ſhines on the Dunghill, and is not therefore a Dunghill-light. Whatever the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was, and his deſign was, all bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; yet God himſelf diſtinguiſheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his own work, and the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Villanies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 12. We are not then to make a confuſion, where the Lord maketh a diſtinction. What is proper to ſinful and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man, let man have: what is proper to a Wiſe, Juſt, Powerful God, let God have. He that holds a ſtone and a piece of Cork un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, is not becauſe he withdraws his hand, the proper intrinſecal cauſe of the one its ſinking, and the others its ſwimming; for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101303:25"/> both ſtone and cork do equally parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate in the hand: the ſtone doth not therefore ſink, becauſe the hand is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn; for then the cork ſhould ſink too: and the cork doth not therefore ſwim; for then the ſtone ſhould ſwim too. This may a little illuſtrate the matter to weaker ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. It's a myſtery, and hath its knots; yet it's unreaſonable therefore ſtill to diſpute, and not to believe. The Scripture doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay before us, how God, Men, and the Devil, had a concurrence in <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe; a work of <hi>Providence</hi> there was, though not for the like end, and in the like manner, with a malicious Devil, and plundering <hi>Sabcans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans: Providence</hi> knoweth how to do cleanly work by the foul hands of ſinners. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was the Trumpet of a glorious Prophecy: He is like a ſervant who broacheth a barrel in a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken humour: the Maſter of the houſe may well puniſh the ſervant for his luſt, and yet wiſely order the veſſel to be drawn forth for the uſe of the family. It's wonderful indeed to conſider, how the Lord's arrows are ſhot in men's bows! and how he throws a Jewel in their Slings! But ſo it is, as it appears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably from that inſtance of <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 11. 50, 51. with 47, 48, 49, 53.</p>
                     <p>The Conſectaries from the Doctrine of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> as here reſpecting the hearts of men, are theſe:</p>
                     <p>1. Abſurd then is the conceit of thoſe who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101303:26"/> would have men exempted from the influx and conflux of <hi>Providence.</hi> The Creatures of a lower form are under the Law of <hi>Providence,</hi> and that too in reference to man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 14. And are not men much better than they, as Chriſt argueth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 26. There is little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and leſs divinity, to deny the ſubjection of the greateſt of men to the controlling <hi>Providence</hi> of God. <hi>Daniel</hi> preached no ſuch Doctrine at Court; he aſſerts before <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The God in whoſe hand thy breath is, and whoſe are all thy ways, haſt thou not glorified,</hi> Dan. 5. 23.</p>
                     <p>2. There is reaſon to eye God's <hi>Providence</hi> even then, when men's hearts are hardned and filled with fury towards perſons. True it is, God inſtilleth no venom of ſin into their hearts; but yet there is a wiſe and righteous hand of <hi>Providence</hi> in this caſe, <hi>—He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal ſubtilly with his ſervants,</hi> Pſal. 105. 25. Men would do well therefore, not only to look upward to God, but alſo inward on their ſouls, and backward on their lives; and may they not cry out then, Men have done us wrong, but God hath done us right? The ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> are injurious, but the hand of <hi>Providence</hi> is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; righteous, righteous!</p>
                     <p>3. It is a pious and prudent courſe to begin with God, when we have to do with men, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in matters of greater conſequence. So did <hi>Eſther;</hi> ſhe faſts, and her Maidens, the Ladies of Honour faſt; and the Jews in <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi> the Metropolitan City, faſt, before ſhe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101303:26"/> maketh her addreſs to <hi>Ahaſuerus, Eſth.</hi> 4. 16. and ſurely there is encouragement ſo to do; for the Lord can work more ways than we can imagine, on the hearts of men: ſometimes he knocks out ſparks of pity from flinty hearts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 46. <hi>He made them alſo to be pitied of all thoſe that carried them captives.</hi> At other times he awes, ſtartles, and doth bring to paſs great things by fears, which take hold on men's ſouls with their tenter-hooks. See <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 29.</p>
                     <p>4. Know to whom the tribute of praiſe and thankfulneſs is due for what of <hi>Providence</hi> is diſplayed in the conveyance of mercies by a touch from Heaven this and that way, on the hearts of men on earth. <hi>David</hi> hath a ſong for God's delivering him out of the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. chap. Now one way of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s delivery, was by an acceſs of <hi>Providence</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi>'s heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with chap. 27. v. 4. The ſame man of God hath left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of God's <hi>Providence</hi> in his deliverance from <hi>Achiſh,</hi> who look't on <hi>David</hi> as a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſo ſlighted him without trial made, or making ſure work with him, who though he had been under a phrenſie for the preſent, might after become a ſober Captain to lead an Army againſt the uncircumciſed; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 14, 15. <hi>Auſtin</hi> relates, how by <note place="margin">Euchirid.</note> the loſs of his way, he found his ſafety in eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the bloody <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who had way-laid him. There was a good man, who travelling on the road, and intending for a certain place, meets with one party, and asketh the way to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101303:27"/> another place for which he intended not, and which place he very well knew. The man ſets forward, and meets with another party, and demandeth alike from him, and puts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the place he intended for, but not the place he ſo asked for. A while after, an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer unknown to him, was following him on the ſcent; and meeting with the firſt party, deſcribes the man whom he hunted for, asking whether the party ſaw ſuch an one? who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, Yea, and he asked the way to ſuch a place. The like anſwer was given him by the next party, who met him. And ſo upon this light given, the man groped in the dark, and the poor Miniſter eſcaped the ſnare, having had a kind of <hi>Providential</hi> Comment with <hi>Auſtin</hi> on that Text, Prov. 20. 24. <hi>Man's goings are of the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>1. The puniſhing of ſin with ſin, or ſin as a righteous judgment of God, is aſcribed to God, and owned by Him. Thus <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>And if the prophet be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>2. The handing good in and through the ſins of men, is the work of <hi>Providence.</hi> The good handed, is (1.) Spiritual: So the death of Chriſt, with the ineſtimable benefits flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, is ſet forward by the ſin of the <hi>Jews; Him being delivered</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>by the determinate counſel and fore-knowledg of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain,</hi> Act. 2. 23. The converſion of ſouls, and the exerciſe of converted ones graces, are ſet forward by the furies of men, through an over-ruling <hi>Providence;</hi> ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14. (2.) Good temporal; or as it referreth to the outward man, is brought about
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101303:28"/> this way. <hi>Joſeph</hi> acknowledgeth ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 7, 8, 9. We read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 13, 14, 15. how the barbarous cruelty of an <hi>Amalekite</hi> towards his ſick ſervant, was an introduction to the recovery of captives and goods, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy there had carried away from <hi>Ziklag.</hi> I have read how the Proteſtants of <hi>Beziers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> were wonderfully preſerved on this wiſe: A drunken Drummer going to his Quarters in the mid-night, rings out the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum-bell of the Town, and at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the Enemies were at the Wall ſeeking and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>3. If God's <hi>Providence</hi> be knock't off from ſinners, his Government will be little, or no Government: for, the greateſt part of men in the world are ſuch, in whoſe hearts ſin hath its regency: ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. this then were to narrow the ſupream regency of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Scriptura oſtendit non ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum bonas renato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum voluntates, quas ipſe facit ex malis; verum etiam illas, quae conſervant ſaeculi creaturam, ita eſſe in Dei poteſtate, ut eas, quò voluerit, quando volueri faciat inclinari, vel ad beneficia quibuſdam praeſtanda, vel ad poena; quibuſdam ingerendas, ſicut ipſe judicat; occultiſſimo quidem judicio, ſed ſine dubitatione juſt iſſimo. <hi>August.</hi> de grat. &amp; lib. arbit. cap. 20.</note> who rules in the midſt of enemies, according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 2.</p>

We may ſafely wade in theſe waters, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Scripture for a guide. Three ways, amongſt others, as explicable in compariſon of other foot-ſteps of <hi>Providence</hi> without foot-ſteps to be ſeen and traced by the weak eye of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man, the Scripture points out: as, (1.) That way of <hi>Providence</hi> in the denial and ſubſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch help, aſſiſtance, proſperous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the Lord is not obliged to give or continue. Thus the Lord, in times paſt, ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own ways, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 16. and ſo the Spirit of the Lord departed from <hi>Saul;</hi> and no wonder then if the ſpirit, in regard of political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, breathes not as formerly, that both Family and Kingdom go down the wind. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 13, 14. Moreover, another way how <hi>Providence</hi> is concerned here, is, by letting looſe Satan this and that way to work. Satan is a skilful Engineer, to go through with the black work which by a Divine permiſſion and commiſſion he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes: ſo its ſaid, <hi>There came forth a ſpirit, and ſtood before the Lord, and ſaid, I will perſwade him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Lord ſaid unto him, Wherewith? and he ſaid, I will go forth, and I will be a lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the mouth of all his prophets: and he ſaid, Thou ſhalt perſwade him, and prevail alſo: go forth and do ſo,</hi> 1 King. 22. 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, There are occaſions offered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wicked ones, yet through their own luſts, are enſnared. The waters of the Sanctuary
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101303:29"/> are pure and good; men's luſts, like lime, are inflamed, when theſe waters are providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally caſt on them. <hi>Amaziah</hi> is cauſleſly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with wholſome counſel. The bridle to check ſin, becomes a ſpurr to edg him on in the road-way of ſin, where he meets with a break-neck fall at laſt, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 15, 16. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for this purpoſe is that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy,</hi> &amp;c. and that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>The word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go and fall backward, and be broken, and ſnared, and taken.</hi> And thus for the Arguments; the Inſtructions follow.</p>
                     <p>1. Take no encouragement to ſin, becauſe God's <hi>Providence</hi> is righteouſly verſant about ſin. Some there were in <hi>Paul</hi>'s days, who did fly-blow his Doctrine, and pretend abſurdities from thence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8.

                        </gap> ſhaped to deniers of Principles; neither was it want of skill that made the Apoſtle deny
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101303:29"/> the concluſion; but wiſdom rather, to direct God's children how to carry themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch as queſtion undoubted Principles: ſtill hold evident truths; yea, though thou know not how to aſſayl doubts raiſed by men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth—The direct anſwer is not here expreſſed by the Apoſtle; partly, for the cavil is ſo odious, that it required rather deteſtation than anſwer; partly, becauſe the anſwer was ſo obvious, that any man might frame it: See what it is; the anſwer is on this manner; That it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, becauſe the illuſtration of God's glory flows not from our ſins, either by the nature of them, or by the intention of the committer; but by accident rather.</p>
                     <p>2. Make not apologies and defences for ſin comitted, by way of reflection on the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. There is an evil this way. <hi>Adam</hi> ſaith, <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt me to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat,</hi> Gen. 3. 12. <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> doth little leſs than glance at <hi>Providence,</hi> in giving a form to the Calf, <hi>I ſaid unto them</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>whoſoever hath any gold, let him break it off: ſo they gave it me, then I caſt it into the fire, and there came out this Calf,</hi> Exod. 32. 24.</p>
                     <p>3. Eye the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in and about ſin; ſo as to admire, love, and thank him, who is wonderfully gracious, even when men are monſtrouſly vicious. <hi>Joſeph</hi> did look through the villanies of his brethren, to the All-wiſe <hi>Providence</hi> of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>Peter,</hi> who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns the Jews of Murder, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.

                     <p>1. Contingents are conſidered, (1.) in equal balance; ſo that the effect and conſequent, before it is, is not determinable more one way, than another. (2.) As having a propendulous and approaching propenſity to one way, more than another.</p>
                     <p>2. Contingents are conſidered, (1.) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of natural things; theſe may for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake be termed Caſual. (2.) In regard of voluntary Agents: Thus the acts of the Will are accounted Contingent, in reſpect of the different objects about which they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101303:30"/> up; and alſo in reſpect of one and the ſame object, but as differently verſant about it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as willing, or nilling.</p>
                     <p>3. Contingents are conſidered as ſingle; or implicated, ſo that there is a combination or conjunction of them as caſual, or voluntary, or both. An exemplification hereof is in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> his caſe; there was an heap of Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, if we conſider, his Father's ſending him to his brethren, or not ſending him; his brethren's ſo acting as they did, or not ſo acting; the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> paſſing by at that time, or not paſſing by; their buying him, or not buying of him: moreover it is ſaid, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was caſt into the pit, and the pit was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there was no water in it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 24. that there was a pit there nigh at hand; and that this pit, which was receptive of water, and probably deſtinated for that end, was now without water, is all contingent. Here we have a Chain of Contingencies, ſome links whereof will contribute to the proof of the matter in hand in what now followeth, both by way of argument and inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, the Scripture plainly aſſerts the extent of <hi>Providence</hi> to contingent matters. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> who had made a deep ſearch both into the works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> atteſteth this; and that, (1.) with reſpect to volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Contingents. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>The preparations of the heart in man, and the anſwer of the tongue, is from the Lord.</hi> Men think to bring forth this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101303:31"/> and that diſh on the table, and in this or that order; but there is a wiſe controlling <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Saepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud ſe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litici quid in confeſſu judicum, ad milites, ad populum, apud principes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturi ſint: ſed reſponſionem linguae, Deus pro ſua Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia temperat. Exempla extant oratorum, qui in magna frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ hominum turpiter obmutuerunt. Concionatores ſaepe rem aliquam, diligenter meditantur: poſtquam vero ſuggeſtum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendunt &amp; omnium oculos in ſe converſos vident, trepidant: &amp; quae diligenter meditati ſunt, quemadmodum optarent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre non poſſunt.

                     <p>Again, (2.) with reſpect to Contingents na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or caſual; and ſo in the ſame Chapter it is ſaid, <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap; but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord,</hi> v. 33. What is more contingent in it ſelf, than a Lot? yet here is the diſpoſing-hand of <hi>Providence</hi> ſeen. Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications there are for this in <hi>Achan:</hi> the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> was taken, then the family, and then the perſon of the family, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 16, 17. and ſo likewiſe in <hi>Saul,</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 21, 22. Thus we have the teſtimony of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and yet behold a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ſame: for, what more contingent, than for a Sparrow to be taken in net, or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led otherwiſe; and yet ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Are not</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:101303:31"/> 
                        <hi>two ſparrows ſold for a farthing? and one of them ſhall not fall to the ground without your Father: Mat.</hi> 10. 29.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If Contingents were without the bridle of <hi>Providence,</hi> God ſhould be ſome petty Lord, not an Abſolute and Univerſal Governour over the World: yea, remove Contingents, and farewel to the Government of the World. Let theſe be dumb Cyphers in the Table of <hi>Providence,</hi> and the ſpeaking Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures will become ſilent ones. To judg by way of proportion; let there be a ſurvey taken of the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> ſet by the Contingencies, and what becomes of that Map or Landskip of <hi>Providence?</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Province of Contingents is of vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; ſo much may be gathered from that paſſage, whether of the wiſe man, or the fooliſh man, brought in by the Wiſe man, yet ſpeaking truth in regard of the extent of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, Eccleſ. 9. 11. <hi>Time and chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Matters of conſiderable and great conſequence, hang on this nail of Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: As,</p>
                     <p>1. The prevention of great dangers. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent-diſpenſation doth ſet a guard to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Joſeph</hi> his life was in an ordinary way (if not ſomewhat extraordinary) ſaved by the empty pit, and the Merchants, who did traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick with his brethren for ſuch living Goods. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> his life did hang on the cord of Contingencies, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 5, 6.</p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:101303:32"/>
                     <p>2. An in-let to great ſtirrs, tumults, and combuſtions, is by virtue of a Contingency. The coal of an inteſtine warr was blown by <hi>Sheba,</hi> who happened (as it is ſaid) to be there: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 1. ſee alſo <hi>Judg.</hi> 8 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>3. Great advancements are brought about by Contingencies. The Butler opens his mouth at Court for <hi>Joſeph;</hi> he was before ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; ingratitude had ſet a Padlock on his lips, as himſelf acknowledgeth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 9. <hi>Eſther</hi> paſſed to her Royal Palace through ſeveral doors of Contingencies. <hi>Mordecai</hi> likewiſe he finds Contingencies to be the golden ſtirrop to his Honours: ſee <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2. 21, 22, 23. and chap. 6. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>4. The invention of Arts, and things of conſiderable conſequence, have drawn their firſt breath by Contingency. The invention of Guns, that deadly inſtrument in warr, which ſome think to be hinted in that of <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Brightm</hi> In locum.</note> 17. is reported to be uſhered into the world by a ſpark of fire falling into a Mortar of ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous matter, and ſo gave an occaſion for an eſſay what Powder would do in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Engine. <hi>Acoſta</hi> relates how the Golden <note place="margin">Hiſtory of the <hi>Indies,</hi> lib. 3. c. 6</note> Mines of the Mountain <hi>Potozi,</hi> were found out by an <hi>Indian</hi> going to hunt for Veniſon; in the purſuit of the Beaſt, the <hi>Indian</hi> laboured to aſcend a ſteep place, and laying hold on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Plants, which yeilding, he eſpied in the hole, or root, metal; and ſo by this means that Golden Mountain was diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>5. By Contingent-diſpenſations the Lord afflicteth the ſons of men as he pleaſeth. The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101303:32"/> bluſtering wind of diſtreſs gets in at this hole. <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Wind, Whale, Gourd, Worm, were all Contingents. <hi>Job</hi> in like ſort drank deep of the Lord's bitter cup; Contingent-<hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> held forth the cup to that ſervant of the Lord. <hi>Thou breakeſt</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>the ſhips of Tarſhiſh with an eaſt-wind,</hi> Pſal. 48. 7.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Notable exploits, victories, are hereby brought about. That <hi>Egyptian</hi> (by whoſe diſcoveries made, <hi>David</hi> became ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30) might not have been ſo left by his Maſter, or elſe have had ſome kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-potion of Soldier-like Phyſick admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to him to put him out of pain: his not being knock't on the head, proves the means for <hi>David</hi>'s knocking down the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who (as it happened) were eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dancing, when <hi>David</hi> falls foul on them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 16, 17. It is obſervable, how in Naval-fights, the Wind, which is a Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent at ſuch a nick of time, is of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And not only at ſea, but at land, doth Victory hang on Contingency. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives a deſcription of an happy concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Contingencies, in order to a triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-conqueſt; and all this with ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Divine Providence. And he will lift up an enſign to the nations from afar, and will hiſs unto them from the end of the earth; and behold, they ſhall come with ſpeed ſwiftly: none ſhall be weary, nor ſtumble amongſt them; none ſhall ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor ſleep; neither ſhall the girdle of their loins be looſed; nor the latchet of their ſhooes be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> Iſa. 5. 26, 27.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:101303:33"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, In the glaſs of Contingent-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations, may be ſeen the Attributes of God in a glorious equipage: As,</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Power</hi> of God, which is notably diſplayed in the Winds, Seas, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 147. 18. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 37.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, as in the preſervation of <hi>Joſeph, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> with others.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God; as when the two Bears came out of the Wood, and devour'd forty and two Children, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>4. The <hi>Verity</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> of God. <hi>Samuel</hi> anoints <hi>Saul</hi> Captain over the Lord's Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. After this, the Lot findeth out <hi>Saul,</hi> though he hid himſelf amongſt the ſtuff, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21, 22. The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided by lot; and the diviſion holdeth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Prophecy of <hi>Jacob</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as may be inſtanced in <hi>Zebulun,</hi> Gen. 49. 13. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>5. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God: By unthought-of Contingencies matters are brought to paſs in God's time. In <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s caſe all the Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents were the Bridg of <hi>Providence</hi> for the Dreams to paſs over into the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> for their real accompliſhment.</p>
                     <p>Having thus given the proof for the extent of <hi>Providence</hi> to contingent matters; there are theſe Leſſons or Inſtructions which are of uſe.</p>
                     <p>1. There is no reaſon to ſlight Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent-diſpenſations. The ſame Will of God is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101303:33"/> the foundation of Contingents, which is of Neceſſaries, or things which are not ſo in themſelves conſidered as Contingent. A Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hath not the like principle of life as an Angel, or Man; and yet the Sparrow falls not to the ground without the will of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 29. Moreover, as hath been intimated, God doth notably diſplay his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by a confederation or concatenation of Contingents. Make not leight then of the leaſt link of the Chain. Remember who cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples all together, and how he uſeth it.</p>
                     <p>2. Here is a check for the proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Adverſaries of the Church. How ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily can God, by a Contingent-diſpenſation, preſent them with ſuch a ſnarled knot which ſhall be too hard for mortal fingers to unty? <hi>Haman</hi> was wonderfully baffled in his Projects, and that by a juncture of Contingencies. The proudeſt Child of <hi>Haman</hi> hath no reaſon to boaſt of to morrow; for the morrow may bring forth the death of the Plot, and the burial of the Plotter. There are Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which to man's apprehenſion, at the firſt, ſeem no otherwiſe than ſo many looſe ſtraws; but with theſe ſtraws, artificially twiſted together by the hand of <hi>Providence,</hi> a Rope is made no leſs ſtrong to bind, than Chains and Fetters of Iron.</p>
                     <p>3. There is great encouragement to live in dependance on God for proviſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Contingent-diſpenſations are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Saints Exchequer and Life-guard. If one had ask'd a godly <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101303:34"/> ſaying, Where is your food? He muſt have anſwered, Above in the Clouds (a very high Cupboard, out of the Children's reach), but on the morrow it will be had out from thence. Again, if it had been ſaid, What if an Enemy ſhall fall on you? It might have been replied, That ſuch a blow happened to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> behind, as no need to fear them for one Forty years: and ſuch fears had fallen in upon the hearts of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> before them; ſo that there's little ground to be diſmayed. Thus, through <hi>Providence,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Frenzy at the Red-ſea, and the <hi>Canaanites</hi> Palſey, was the means of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſafety.</p>
                     <p>4. Take notice of Mercies conveyed on the wings of Contingent-diſpenſations. In this Treaſure-houſe are Mercies of all ſorts. The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> happened to come in a good time to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well, where the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life was open for her, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>Ruth</hi> goes a gleaning, and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging to <hi>Boaz,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2, 3. and from a Gleaner ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Miſtreſs in <hi>Boaz</hi> his Family, to whom ſhe married, and at marriage hath the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the good people in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> which prayers of her neighbours had a glorious iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; no leſs than Grandfather to a King is born to the joy of <hi>Naomi, Boaz, Ruth,</hi> and the reſt of the people of <hi>Bethelehem:</hi> See <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 11. to the end.</p>

                     <p>That the <hi>Providence</hi> of God extendeth to the deaths of men, may be illuſtrated,
<list>
                           <item>1. More generally.</item>
                           <item>2. Particularly.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, In the general, It appears from theſe and the like Arguments.</p>
                     <p>1. God giveth life; and no longer than he upholds life, doth it laſt. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>carrieſt them away as with a flood,</hi> Pſal. 90. 5. The Jews went about to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> yet their deſign was ineffectual; as <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the reaſon, ſaying, <hi>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,</hi> Acts 26. 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>2. If the <hi>Providence</hi> of God ſtoops to a Sparrow's falling on the ground, why not to the grave of a Man? and yet Sparrows are not long-liv'd birds, as Naturaliſts obſerve: they are birds of little value too. To deny then the inference from Sparrows to Men, is to aſperſe our Saviour's Logick, for ſo is the ſcope of the Argument urged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 29. with 31.</p>
                     <p>3. Death is an Evil of ſmart; and ſhall there be <hi>any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos 3. 6.</p>
                     <p>4. On the death of ſome perſons, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of a whole Nation is uſhered in: that is a ſignificant place of Scripture for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in Lam. 4. 20. <hi>The breath of our noſtrils,</hi>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101303:35"/> 
                        <hi>the anointed of the Lord was taken in their pits, of whom we ſaid, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder his ſhadow we ſhall live among the heathen.</hi> And thus briefly in the general.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the next place, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, Conſider the extent of <hi>Providence,</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. To the Kinds of death.</item>
                           <item>2. To the Timing of death.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, As for the Kinds of death, they may be diſtinguiſht thus:</p>
                     <p>1. Natural; as being affixt to nature ſince the fall of our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. By natural death here, is underſtood the diſſolution of man from Principles of Mortality with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though there ſhould not be any violence from without: Thus ſome, according to the Providential diſpoſition of the Almighty, come to <hi>the grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of corn cometh in his ſeaſon,</hi> Job 5. 26. ſee for this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 10.</p>
                     <p>2. Violent; when the candle of life burns not out, but is puft out, and that by the hot breath of a raging Enemy, or the ſentencing-mouth of the Magiſtrate. <hi>Job</hi>'s ſervants were ſlain by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> but not without the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, as <hi>Job</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, chap. 1, 15, 17, 21. <hi>Achan</hi> is ſtoned to death; and yet glory is due to the Lord whom <hi>Achan</hi> had offended, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 19, 25, 26.</p>
                     <p>3. Caſual; which though it may be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet is here conſidered as not intended by
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101303:35"/> men as Agents, or Inſtruments. God's <hi>Providence</hi> reacheth to Chance-medly. The ſlaying of man accidentally, is ſaid to be God's <hi>delivering a man into the hand of the ſlayer:</hi> ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The timing of the deaths of men, hath its reference to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God: for as he <hi>ſets bounds to the ſea,</hi> Job 38. 8. and <hi>hath determined the bounds of mens habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Acts 17. 26. ſo he hath not left the lives of men boundleſs. The truth of this will appear,</p>
                     <p>1. From plain places of Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming ſo. Job 7. 1. <hi>Is there not an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time to man upon the earth? Are not his days like the days of an hireling?</hi> Job 15. 5. <hi>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 1, 2. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; a time to be born, and a time to dye.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Divinity, time or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for things fall under the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, and particularly, <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>death</hi> are in the front of the catalogue of the inſtances there: which we are (as one obſerveth) to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand only according to the event, what things fall out after God's appointment; not the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or unlawfulneſs of them, what things ſhould be by God's commandment.</p>
                     <p>2. From the reaſon rendered in Scripture, why ſome are not ſooner removed out of the world by the hands of violence, notwithſtanding
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101303:36"/> promiſſory, or rather comminatory probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. John 7. 30. <hi>Then they ſought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, becauſe his hour was not yet come.</hi> The ſame reaſon is repeated <hi>John</hi> 8. 20. Chriſt backs the ſame reaſon as ſolid and true, when he ſaid to his apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye ſtretched forth no hands againſt me: but this is your hour and power of darkneſs,</hi> Luk. 22. 53.</p>
                     <p>3. From the verity of God in timing the deaths of perſons according to particular predictions. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>For before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good, the land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her kings. Pekah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Remaliah,</hi> was one of thoſe Kings, and his death is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 30. It is ſaid of the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> Iſa. 37. 7. <hi>I will cauſe him to fall by the ſword in his own land.</hi> Here was a prediction of death, the kind of it, and the place where; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it was fulfilled, as it is recorded in the 37, 38 verſes of the ſame Chapter.</p>
                     <p>4. From the peculiar Prerogative of God, as he is (1.) the God of Mercies, and ſo he hands Mercies to men, 1. by their own deaths; <hi>they are taken away from the evil to come.</hi> God houſeth them in Heaven before the black ſtorms fall out on the earth. See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1. 2. By the deaths of others, who are thorns in the ſides of his people; the burning up of theſe thorns is a joyful bonfire. So in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>Hazael</hi> oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael;</hi> in ver. 23. <hi>The Lord was gracious to them, and had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them,</hi> &amp;c. Now how the Lord ſhews
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101303:36"/> himſelf thus gracious and compaſſionate, we have in <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>So Hazael the King of Syria died.</hi> Thus the Lord is a God of Mercies even in the deaths of men. But then (2.) as the God of Judgment; and ſo not only wrath, but great wrath, comes forth on the ſtage of the World in timing the deaths of perſons. The glorious terribleneſs of Juſtice is here ſeen; as (1.) when <hi>Providence</hi> ſuddenly ſnatcheth a man from his fancied Paradiſe; <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 12. 20. Death, as <hi>Providence</hi> doth judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally time it, hath a ſting in its ſting: ſo in that Monarch, who was ſlain in his Royal City by his own Sons, and while at his devotions in the Houſe of <hi>Niſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>och</hi> his god. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 37, 38. (2.) When the deaths of many thouſands are timed together: <hi>The Lord is known by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he executeth,</hi> Pſal. 9. 16. We read of Seventy thouſand men who dyed of the Plague in three days time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 15. And in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 29. the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlew of the <hi>Syrians</hi> an hundred thouſand foot-men in one day. Now if there were not a <hi>Providence</hi> in the timing the deaths of perſons, the glory of Divine Juſtice would have its grave with the vaſt multitudes who fall by Famine, Sword, or Peſtilence; all which are the Lord's Arrows, as the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> informeth <hi>David</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>5. From the ſucceſs and non-ſucceſs of means uſed in order to the proroguing or lengthning forth of life. The preſervatives of life are conſervative of it no otherwiſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101303:37"/> than as the Lord pleaſeth. This may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd in three things.</p>
                     <p>1. In the uſe of Medicinal means, which ſometimes (very improbable to reaſon), avail to the recovery of health, and that though the perſon were mortally ſick in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt accurate Phyſicians. There ſeemeth to be ſomething of <hi>Providence</hi> by way of proportion to that Cure wrought on <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> by the lump of Figs, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 21. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that Cure extraordinary, and ſhall not diſpute the queſtion, Whether the lump of Figs might not have ſomething of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency by way of cure? This is that I contend for, That <hi>Providence</hi> is very much ſeen, if not in elevating improbable means, in themſelves conſidered, in order to a cure; yet in bringing to light ſuch means which are improbable to mans reaſon, though very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the recovery of the Patient, who, like <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> was ſick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 27. And as the Lord's mercy, and <hi>Providence</hi> is diſplayed in the raiſing of perſons from the grave; ſo no leſs may the hand of <hi>Providence</hi> be ſeen in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the means us'd for health ſucceſleſs A Colledg of Phyſicians are Phyſicians of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, when, and where the Lord, the great Phyſician, withdraws his manutenancy, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hand of <hi>Providence:</hi> witneſs this in <hi>Aſa,</hi> who had his Phyſicians, but not his cure; dye he muſt; his diſeaſe lodgeth him in his grave, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 12, 13.</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:101303:37"/>
                     <p>But, 2<hi>dly,</hi> in the matter of Diet; ſome Creatures have more of a reſtorative virtue than others; and yet ſome are healthier, fairer, live longer with their Pults, than others who eat their portion of the King's meat. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 12, 15. Whence is this? the word doth plainly leſſon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 25. <hi>He ſhall bleſs thy bread, and thy water; and I will take ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs away from thee.</hi> And Mat. 4. 4. <hi>Man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, In the greateſt caution or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection men uſe to preſerve themſelves in dangers. The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> diſguiſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and hath his Armour; yet an Arrow finds its paſſage between the joynts of his Harneſs, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. On the other hand <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat,</hi> who was in the ſame fight, and in greater danger than King <hi>Abab,</hi> is preſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>It came to paſs</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>when the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Charives ſaw Jehoſaphat</hi> (in his Royal Robes) <hi>that they ſaid, It is the king of Iſrael; therefore they compaſſed about him to fight: but Jehoſaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him: and God moved them to depart from him,</hi> 2 Chron. 18. 31.</p>
                     <p>6<hi>thly,</hi> and laſtly, From the abſurdity which would otherwiſe follow. For if the timing of men's lives here in the world, be not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bounds which the Lord ſets; then to whom ſhall the glory in point of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be attributed? Shall men think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or acknowledg Fortune, in contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101303:38"/> to <hi>Providence?</hi> The Scripture otherwiſe teacheth, Pſal. 31. 15. <hi>My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and from them that perſecute me.</hi> And Pſal. 68. 20. <hi>He that is our God, is the God of ſalvation: and unto God the Lord belong the iſſues from death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place it remains, that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply be made to the Objections which look, and do but look, the matter here aſſerted in the face; and they are as followeth.</p>
                     <p>1. Fifteen years are ſaid to be added to the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38. 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The addition there is no new Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it reſpects the Purpoſe of God; it is rather a new Edition of the Purpoſe of God; a diſcovery of what lay hid before, and is now made manifeſt, notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary might be concluded in reſpect of the malignity of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s diſeaſe. To aſſert, that there was a new Purpoſe of God, becauſe of the declaration of the Prophet there, were to make a new God, who is ſtill the Ancient of days, and <hi>with whom is no variableneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhadow of turning,</hi> as the Scripture affirms Him to be, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>James</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                     <p>2. It may be objected, That in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 23. <hi>Bloody and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:101303:38"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The days of men are conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 10. <hi>The days of our years are threeſcore years and ten,</hi> &amp;c. and according to the courſe of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence,</hi> which holds an exact accord with the Purpoſe or Determination of God. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith the Prophet to <hi>Amaziah</hi>) <hi>that God hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt done this, and haſt not hearkened unto my counſel,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 16. Men live not then half their days, according to the probable courſe of Nature, though they dye according to the number of days fore-known or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God.</p>
                     <p>3. It may be objected, That ſome are the cauſe of their own death, and ſo dye before their time, according to what is ſaid, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou dye before thy time?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The ſame will hold, if it had ſtrength, as to others being the cauſe of the death of others, as the Jews, who killed Chriſt; and yet this horrid fact of theirs was conſiſtent with the ſtated time of Chriſt's Miniſtry on earth, as was before proved, <hi>John</hi> 7. 30. <hi>John</hi> 8. 20. <hi>John</hi> 13. 1.</p>
                     <p>2. However ſome are the cauſe of their own death, yet not without the wiſe <hi>Providence</hi> of God, either as righteouſly puniſhing them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 23. or graciouſly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizing them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</hi> So <hi>Joſiah</hi> is in a ſort acceſſory to his own
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101303:39"/> death; and yet he dyes in peace, whilſt he dyes in warr: his death was but a ſanctified flea-biting in compariſon of the evil to come on his Kingdom; he is removed from being a heart-broken Spectator of them, and lives not to be the object of a barbarous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Adverſary's reproach and cruelty. See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. and 36: chap.</p>
                     <p>Now from what hath been ſaid as touching the extent of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> to the death of perſons, theſe four following Conſectaries or Leſſons may be commended.</p>
                     <p>1. There is no reaſon to give way to anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſquieting thoughts, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of difficulties, dangers, caſualties, which may attend our ſelves, or thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, in the way or calling in which God by his Providence engageth in according to his word, warranting the way or calling. There is an irregular fear and diſquiet, which leaps objectively from the black face of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, into the hearts of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Our Saviour intimates ſo much in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. the diſeaſe there, is Fears about the body; and the cure of this diſeaſe, is by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Shop of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> where a remedy may be had, <hi>v.</hi> 29. the ſweet and ſerious meditation on <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> is the beſt Cordial under all fears and diſquiets of this nature. It comes to be the death of fears
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101303:39"/> and diſquiets which referrs to death. There is a ſtory of an Husbandman and Sea-man communing together: The Husbandman asks the Sea-man, Of what Civil Profeſſion his Father was? He replies, A Sea-man as he was, and ſo likewiſe was his Grandfather too. The Husbandman enquires, where his Father died? Anſwer is made, At Sea, and ſo did his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father too. Hereupon ſaith the Husbandman, Are you not afraid to go to Sea? The Sea-man asks the Husbandman, of what Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was his Father? and after, his Grandfather? and it being anſwered, They were both Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen; he further asketh, where they died? Anſwer is made, At home in their beds. And are not you (ſaith the Sea-man) afraid to go to bed? The application of this ſtory is eaſie, and needs not a ſcrew.</p>
                     <p>2. It's wiſdom then for perſons to intereſt themſelves in the God of <hi>Providence. Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 145. 15. there are two great encouragements to look after an intereſt in God, as reconciled to the ſoul in and through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>(1.) None go with ſo ſtrong a guard, as they who have thus <hi>the Lord for their God.</hi> Chriſt tells his Diſciples, that the very hairs of their head were all numbred, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 30.</p>
                     <p>(2.) Whatever diſtreſſes Saints meet withal, ſuppoſe a violent death, they have a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſon or remedy againſt the evil of the evils.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101303:40"/> The Lord's <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> loſe their heads, but not an hair; they are then gainers when they ſeem to be loſers. There is enough by death to make amends for death: <hi>Bleſſed are they which dye in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13.</p>
                     <p>3. It may quiet the ſpirit, when God takes away, by death, Friends, Relations, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: Theſe dye not at hap-hazzard. The God of Wiſdom placeth and diſplaceth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World, and all wiſely and righteouſly. If Children are with us like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, for a night; and then a Worm eats them to a withering. There is no reaſon to quarrel with the Lord, who hath variety of wiſe Ends in the Gourd-diſpenſation of this Nature; We have reaſon to quarrel with our unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quarrellings at the Lord's bereaving us of Relations. There was never a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but a Funeral as conſequent: And yet doth not the Funeral of Relations uſher in the Funerals of quietneſs and thankfulneſs to God for the loan of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Relations ſo long? If one lend us an hundred pounds for ſome years freely, and after calls for it; Is there ground for diſquiet and fullenneſs, as if ſo be there had been no courteſie at all for divers years? How often do we forget our ſelves as men, and much more as Chriſtians, in matters of this nature! The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth caution againſt irregular ſorrow for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101303:40"/> death of perſons, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 13. and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <note place="margin">Illud quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, quâ juſtitiâ in omnibus rebus es, neceſſe eſt te adjuvet, cogitantem, Non injuriam tibi factam, quod talem fratrem amiſiſti, ſed beneficium datum, quod tam diu pietate ejus tibi uti fruique licuit. <hi>Seneca</hi> de conſolatione ad <hi>Polybium.</hi>
                        </note> Copy is left for us to write by, when Death ſets its cold hand on any of our friends, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22, 23.</p>
                     <p>4. What ground is here for a mortifi'd frame of ſpirit both to things and perſons in the world? Our days, and the days of others, will have their period. We and others are like paſſengers in a Ship; who, whether they ſit, walk on the Decks, or ſleep in the Cabins, are in motion towards the Haven. The World is rather an Inn, than an accuſtomed Home-Stall, or Dwelling-houſe: one generation paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and another cometh, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 4. It's folly then for the ſons of men to be el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-deep in the thick clay of the world; as if ſo be they and their wealth, their pomp and their pleaſures, were to abide here for ever. Oh that what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth, were engraven on the heart with a pen of Iron, and the point of a Diamond! <hi>But this I ſay, brethren, The time is ſhort; it remaineth that both they that have wives, be as though they bad none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 29, 30. 31.</p>

                     <p>That the <hi>Providence</hi> of God extendeth to the meaneſt creatures, and things trivial or of leſs moment in human apprehenſion, comes in the laſt place to be inſiſted on; and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be ſo from the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>1. The Lord made creeping things as well as the Whales and Elephants. This is plain from the Hiſtory of the Creation, as is made manifeſt in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 24, 25. Now if the Creation be comprehenſive of things which move in a leſs ſphere of activity; Why ſhould the ſaid things be look't on as below the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in point of gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernation, and ordering them to his own glory?</p>
                     <p>2. Theſe are a part of the Univerſe, and ſo fall under the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. The little-finger is not excluded from the influence of the Soul, becauſe it is not of equal bigneſs with a limb of the body-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: if ſo in Man, the little World, as he is termed by ſome; Why ſhould it not hold, by the like parity of reaſon, in the greater World?</p>
                     <p>3. We find how the Lord hath conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to give informations and directions
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101303:41"/> about meaner matters.

                     <p>4.

Whether the proviſion for the young Ravens, ſpoken of in that place of <hi>Job,</hi> be by worms out of the dung in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neſts, or by flyes croſſing over the heads of the young ones, which flyes are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive, and ſo ſerve for food; I ſhall not largely diſcuſs: it's enough to note, that they are cheriſh'd, and that both ways, as is obſerved by ſome.

                     <p>6. If God's <hi>Providence</hi> ſhould be deni'd to ſmaller matters; then,</p>
                     <p>1. Might it not as well be deni'd to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er matters? For ſmaller matters, conſidered in their connextions, become greater matters. Who knows what are the notable products, it may be, of things, little heeded by ſome for the preſent ſeaſon? Beſides, a fair way is laid open to deny God's <hi>Providence</hi> in greater matters; which become not ſo great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially conſidered, as was before intimated. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells a ſtory, how when one had ſaid, That the Fly was made by the Devil; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Manichee</hi> inſinuates, That then by the ſame Devil is made the Bee, Locuſt, Lizzard, Oxe, Elephant, and ſo Man—. Knock off <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in leſſer matters, and a way is laid open for one to play the <hi>Manichee</hi> in greater.</p>
                     <p>But 2<hi>dly,</hi> To deny God's <hi>Providence</hi> in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matters, is to break that ſeries or chain whereby Divine Wiſdom hath ordered all. As in the workmanſhip of the Tabernacle, there were Loops and Taches, and theſe had their uſe; and without theſe, What would become of the Tabernacle? So here, <hi>Providence</hi> takes in a Loop, a Tach, as well as the Purple, Blew, and Scarlet, of greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>3.

More generally, ſeeing its glorious for God to have all at his check and controll.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101303:43"/> (2.)

                     <p>THE truth of this appears, (1.) From po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive aſſertions in Scripture, Eccleſ. 3. 11. <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: alſo he hath ſet the world in their hearts, ſo that no man can find out the work that God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from the beginning to the end.</hi> (2.) From the Lord's poſing parties about his <hi>Providence:</hi> When he takes the matter in hand, as in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> How did the Lord argue him into a modeſt ſilence? See chap. 38, 39, 40, 41. with chap. 42. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. (3.) From errors and miſtakes about God's <hi>Providence;</hi> which have more or leſs ſeized on not only men, but the beſt of men. <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends were no Atheiſts, but good men; yet ſaith the Lord unto <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite, My wrath is kindled againſt thee, and againſt thy two friends: for ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant Job hath,</hi> Job 42. 7.

Who hath gathered the wind in his fiſts? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the ends of the earth? What is his name? Or what is his Son's name, if thou canſt tell?</hi> Prov. 30. 2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the truth of this will further be evidenced, if we conſider,</p>
                     <p>1. The Object, <hi>viz.</hi> Providential diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
                     <p>2. The Subject, Man under this or that diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe. The Scripture doth inform how that the Lord is <hi>wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working,</hi> Iſa. 28. 19. and <hi>he only doth wondrous things,</hi> Pſal. 72. 18. Look as what comes out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſhop, beſpeaks the skill of the great Workman of Heaven and Earth; ſo there are ſome divine pieces of Workmanſhip (if I may ſo ſpeak after the manner of men) which hold men at an amazing or aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-gaze. More particularly: Two things in Divine diſpenſations of <hi>Providence</hi> do nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gravel the ſons of men. (1.) The unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualneſs of a Diſpenſation. <hi>Rebeccah</hi>'s Warr in her bowels makes her ſay, <hi>If it be ſo, why am I thus? and ſhe went to enquire of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 25. 22. <hi>Job</hi>'s afflictions in ſuch ſort,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101303:46"/> and befalling ſuch an one who keeps up com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; yea, prays for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, leſt in their regular ſolace of themſelves together, they ſhould be irregular; muſt in all likelihood ſtartle himſelf and his friends; who probably obſerving how God did then ordinarily bleſs the Tabernacle of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in regard of outward proſperity, were the ſooner induced to paſs wrong cenſure on that holy man of God. But in the next place, The intricacy of a Diſpenſation doth likewiſe contribute to the non-pluſſing or baffling of a party under the Diſpenſation. We read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 16. of <hi>a wheel within a wheel:</hi> Whether that be to be underſtood inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, as one wheel within being out of ken, and ſo there is a ſecret winding of matters which the eye of reaſon diſcerneth not: or, whether in a tranſverſe ſenſe; and ſo it notes the thwart or croſs-turnings of things; when one while matters go this way, and another while that way, I determine not: either of the interpretations give us the thing here contended for. To this we may add ſome exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications of the intricacy of <hi>Providence.</hi> That in <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. where the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a good Cauſe and a Divine Warrant to fight <hi>Benjamin;</hi> and yet they were worſted and put to the rout. <hi>Jacob</hi> had warrant to return to his Countrey; a promiſe that God would deal well with him in that return, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9. and yet behold a <hi>Providence</hi> which ſeemingly claſhed with the Promiſe! Is this (might Reaſon be ready enough to prompt <hi>Jacob</hi> in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101303:46"/> the ear) to be dealt well with? What! to have thy throat cut by <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Ruffians! Here is a returning to thy Kindred indeed, by returning to thy duſt! And yet <hi>Jacob</hi>'s black cloud blows over, and the Promiſe and the <hi>Providence</hi> do more ſweetly kiſs each other than the two Brethren do.</p>
                     <p>In the next place conſider, conſider the Subject; and ſo man is not much unlike <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s <hi>Harpeſten,</hi> who complained the room was dark, when ſhe was blind. The light of <hi>Providence</hi> is not ſo taken in; partly, by reaſon of darkneſs in the underſtanding; for, <hi>we know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9. and partly, by reaſon of turbulent paſſions; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing croſſed in this or that diſpenſation, do raiſe a ſog or miſt, which cloud the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. How is <hi>David</hi> tranſported on the death of <hi>Abſalom!</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 33. How doth <hi>Jonah</hi>'s pride and paſſion hinder him from ſubſcribing to the Wiſdom and Mercy of God in ſparing <hi>Niniveh!</hi> ſee <hi>Jonah</hi> chap. 4. Men had need therefore watch againſt charming luſts and paſſions, which otherwiſe will joyn their additional iſſue with the intrinſick darkneſs of the underſtanding; and ſo, like the Earth, interpoſe between them and the light of <hi>Providence.</hi>

                     <p>1. NO ground to throw by the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Diſpenſations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our knowledg of them is not a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive knowledg. It is a dangerous inference from that of <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, in which are ſome things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. to reject therefore the reading of the Sacred Scriptures. The like inference here from the things hard to be underſtood in the courſe of God's <hi>Providence,</hi> is of dangerous conſequence. What is ſaid of the Scriptures, how <hi>it is a River wherein the Elephant may ſwim, and yet the Lamb may wade;</hi> the ſame, by way of proportion, may be ſaid as touching the Lord's Providential Diſpenſations; ſome of which, gravel the profoundeſt; others are underſtood by the meaneſt for their inſtruction. <hi>Haman</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and his Wiſe <hi>Zereſh,</hi> learn't a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary leſſon in the School of <hi>Providence,</hi> they bid him beware how he engage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Mordecai,</hi> a Child of <hi>Providence: Eſth.</hi> 6. 13. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informeth, how there is a common Catechiſm of <hi>Providence</hi> for the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. Moreover, it may be well remembred here, That ſome Diſpenſations of <hi>Providence</hi> which are dark for a time, may after become light to the induſtrious and waiting Chriſtian on his God. <hi>When I thought to know this, it was too pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me; until I went into the Sanctuary of</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:101303:47"/> 
                        <hi>God: then underſtood I their end,</hi> Pſal. 73. 16, 17. Laſtly, Such myſteries and riddles of <hi>Providence,</hi> the depth whereof we are not able to fathom; yet by the light of God's word we are taught to ſubſcribe unto, and to reſt contented, by way of admiration, where we cannot reach by way of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight,</hi> Mat. 11. 26.</p>
                     <p>2. No reaſon for any mortal man to pride himſelf in his attainments. Though a man be got up on the Mountain of <hi>Providence,</hi> and others are in the Valley, yet that man is far enough from touching the sky. Two things may check pride upon the account of knowledg here. (1.) The Angels in Heaven may learn by the <hi>Providences</hi> of God on earth. That Heavenly Academy admits of an addition of experimental knowledg; ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. No man therefore knows ſo much, but he may know more; and to be lifted up with high apprehenſion of man's apprehenſions, is ſo far from being wiſe as an Angel of God, as that the man lies open to the condemnation of the Devil, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. But (2<hi>dly</hi>) he who hath an high conceit about his knowledg in Divine Diſpenſations, may quickly be miſtaken in matters, and pay deer for his miſtake. We find how a good Prophet, by a pretended <hi>Providence</hi> of an Angel's appearing, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on to do otherwiſe than he ſhould have done, and that to the loſs of his life, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 18, 24. Though a man therefore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101303:48"/> have made more progreſs in the ſearch of <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> than others; yet let him remember, his knowledg is rather a twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light-one, than Meridian; and let him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in Pſal. 2. 11. <hi>ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. From this, learn to bid an hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to ſuch means, helps, furtherances, as God vouchſafeth for the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his diſpenſations. This inference is rational from the premiſed Theſes or Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Cripple needs his Crutches, and no reaſon to throw them away till he can go without them. There are two moving Conſiderations here:</p>

                     <p>2. Matters in Scripture are inſiſted on, as having a reference to God's Decree or Will.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101303:49"/> (1.) Some things are referred to God by way of proper efficiency. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>veſſels of mercy which the Lord had afore prepared unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9. ver. 23. What this preparing of the Lord is, the ſame Apoſtle doth give to underſtand, not only in that Chapter, but elſewhere, as Eph. 1. <hi>According as he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame, before him in love; having predeſtinated us unto the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> v. 4, 5. and not only good ſupernatural, as Vocation, Juſtification, and the like, center in the Purpoſe or Will of God, as the Apoſtle here ſheweth: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, good natural and moral; for <hi>he hath made a decree for the rain,</hi> Job 28. 26. <hi>The fire and hail, ſnow and vapours, ſtormy wind, fulfil his word,</hi> Pſal. 148. 8. <hi>Every good and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights,</hi> James 1. 17. (2.) Other matters have a reference to the Decree or Will of God, by way of a wiſe, righteous permiſſion. It may be obſerved how the Apoſtle ſpeaks differently of the veſſels of mercy, and the veſſels of wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. the veſſels of mercy the Lord is ſaid to prepare unto glory, <hi>v.</hi> 23. the veſſels of wrath, are ſaid only to be fitted to deſtruction, <hi>v.</hi> 22. God infuſeth no evil into them; and yet the evil of ſin cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Will ſo permitting; not by way of approbation, but phyſical non-impedition, There is indeed a curious and ſpotleſs arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even in and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101303:50"/> about the ſins of men. He never acts defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently from the Rule of his Eternal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and therefore the Lord's Willing ſin in a ſenſe, is not to be ignorantly jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together with man's not-hindering, who is under a Law to hinder it. I ſee no reaſon then to deny the reference that ſin hath to the Will or Purpoſe of God. The <note place="margin">Necdubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum eſt, Deum facere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do fieri quaecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que male: non enim hoc niſi juſto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, &amp; profecto bonum eſt, omne quod juſtum eſt: nam niſi hoc eſſet bonum, ut eſſent &amp; mala, nullo modo eſſe ſinerentur ab Omnipotente Bono, cui procul dubio, quam facile eſt, quod vult, facere, tan facile eſt, quod non vult eſſe, non finere. <hi>August.</hi> in Enchirid. cap. 96.</note> hand of <hi>Providence</hi> writ the Copy of Eternal Love in Chriſt's Sufferings; the Pen had its hair, and that its blot, a very great and black one; and yet what ſaith <hi>Peter?</hi> Acts 2. 23. <hi>Him being delivered by the determinate counſel and fore-knowledg of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> Add to this, that in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27, 28. which ſeems to be a full and clear confeſſion of the Church in this point.</p>

An inſtance full for this, is, the not breaking the legs of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 19. 33, 36. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth alſo inter <hi>calling,</hi> &amp;c. from <hi>predeſtination,</hi> Rom. 8. 30. yea, he doth infer a patient bearing of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive diſpenſations, on this wiſe, ſaying, that <hi>no man ſhould be moved by theſe afflictions; for</hi>

                     <p>4. Inſtruments, in their actings, have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to the Purpoſe or Will of God. In <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s viſion, the wheels are mov'd by the living creatures; they go whither the Spirit was to go, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 12. And not only Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments miniſterial, who act knowingly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly; but others, who intend no conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Will or Purpoſe of God in matters brought to paſs, do yet pay a kind of tribute to the Lord's Will; as in the ſelling of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the crucifying of Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27, 28.</p>
                     <p>5. If the Lord's Will be not the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diſpenſations, then ſomething elſe muſt take place; and if men, as the nobleſt of creatures here below, ſhall have the Chair of State, then to ſacrifice to their own net, and to burn incenſe unto their drag, will be found good divinity, which the Prophet cenſures as bad, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 16.

                     <p>1. BE the more confirmed in the truth of this Obſervation. Look not on the Will or Purpoſe of God as a Plant of Time, but as the Eternal Root of what comes to paſs in Time. And good reaſon is there ſo to do; for, (1.) The Scripture carries the Purpoſe of God with reſpect to matters beyond their preſent exiſtencies in the world, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. (2.) The glorious Attributes of God ſpeak another language than ſo, as if he were not reſolved on the government of the world, till things have their exiſtencies: for, (1.) He is <hi>Omniſcient</hi> from all eternity: He knows matters before they exiſt, or have an actual beeing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He is <hi>Omnipotent;</hi> nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth his will. <hi>He ſpake, and it was done,</hi> Pſal. 33. 9. <hi>Power belongeth to him,</hi> Pſal. 62. 10. (3.) He is <hi>Independent</hi> in his operations: He lacquies not after the Creatures; none of the Creatures give to him, ſo that a new Purpoſe hereupon is originally framed, which was not before, although not declared. God is no ſuch debtor to any of the Creatures. Find
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101303:51"/> out the Creature to whom God is ſuch a debtor, and the debt ſhall be well paid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35. (4.) He is <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable;</hi> there is not the leaſt change in Him. He is not a yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day God purpoſing, and to day a God not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, and to morrow a God purpoſing, or on the contrary, a yeſterday not purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and to day purpoſing, and to morrow not purpoſing: no, no; <hi>He is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 19. <hi>The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever: the thoughts of his heart to all generations,</hi> Pſal. 33. 11.</p>
                     <p>2. Look not on man's [<hi>I will</hi>] ſo, as to forget that God's Will or Purpoſe muſt take place. How many live as if Men were God, and God but <note place="margin">Scito autem homo. nullum tibi adverſari potuiſſe, niſi Deus poteſtatem dediſſet, nec poteſtatem habuiſſet in te adverſarius, niſi permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret Deus.

                     <p>3. Ruſh not into ſin, nor plead for it upon a pretence of the Divine Will or Decree. Shall <hi>Adam</hi> plead thus with the Lord, If thou hadſt not decreed to make the woman, and accordingly to give her to me to wiſe, I had not had forbidden fruit from her; 'twas <hi>the woman thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat,</hi> Gen. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE truth of this appears: For,</p>
                     <p>1. There is a ſufficiency of Power to bring about what is not, and may never be; and what is not, and yet may be, when the Lord ſhall ſee it good to be, and after this or that ſort to be. The Lord is deſcribed in Scripture as the great Potter of the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21. and ſo he hath a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for poſſible veſſels, not to be; and for ſuch veſſels as are intentionally to be, not to be of this faſhion or ſhape, of ſuch a bigneſs, and not to be at ſuch a time, but when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath well ſtated this point, Why all fleſh is not the ſame fleſh; Why one Starr hath not the like glory for degree that another hath; Why the grain ſown thrives; and ſo conſequently, why when it thrives not: He reſolves all into the good will of God, as that paſſage of his imports; <hi>but God giveth it a body as it hath pleaſed him,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 38. The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> tells the Phariſees
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101303:54"/> and Sadduces, That God is able of the ſtones preſent before their eyes, to raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham, Mat.</hi> 3. 5. Why the ſtones are not multiplied into children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> is from the Lord's will: the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> they had Manna in the wilderneſs, which neither they nor their fathers knew before, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 3. and whence is this, but from the Lord's will, not to give it in <hi>Egypt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The reaſon rendred in Scripture, why things are not, is plain and poſitive, if an eye be had to the Lord's Dominionſhip. Thus in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. where it is ſaid, <hi>There was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 5. And how ſo? <hi>for God did vex them with all adverſity,</hi> v. 6. Like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, is that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 47. 6, 7. <hi>O thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thy ſelf into thy ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill. How can it be quiet, ſeeing the Lord hath given it a charge againſt Aſhkelon and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore? there hath he appointed it.</hi> The Lord could, if he had pleaſed, have given to the people exiſtent in thoſe black times, better hearts, and ſo they had had better times; or might have vouchſafed fat times of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and plenty, and ſo they might be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually puniſht with blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart. That therefore there is no peace, the ſword is not ſtill and quiet, is from the Lord, though ſin doth intervene as the procuring-cauſe of ſuch ſad diſpenſations.</p>

                     <p>3. The verity or faithfulneſs of God is concerned herein, why things are not, as well as why they are. There are predictions which reach the denial of this or that to be. <hi>All fleſh ſhall not be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither ſhall there any more be flood to deſtroy the earth,</hi> ſpake the Lord to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9. 11. No ſucceſs for an <hi>Ahab</hi> at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> 1 King. 21. 28. <hi>Shall he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, ſhall he eſcape that doth ſuch things? or ſhall he break the Covenant, and be delivered? Ezek.</hi> 17. 15. So not a bone of Chriſt to be broken, becauſe the Scripture ſo fore-told. <hi>John.</hi> 19. 36. So <hi>Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many,</hi> Heb. 9. 28.</p>
                     <p>4. There is a rich Treaſure-houſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this ſeemingly empty houſe of <hi>Things not to be.</hi> It's not beyond infinite Power, and affronted Juſtice, and contriving Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to elevate the moſt ſmarting troubles that are in the world, above what they are. The Lord knows how to find out new ones, and to put more teeth, and ſharper ones, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the old ones. Yea, the worm that dieth not, and the fire that goeth not out, can be made to bite deeper, and burn fiercer. Not only is there mercy in the non-conſtitution of new ſmarts, or heightning old ones; but in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off ſuch ſmarts for the kind of them, as others are made the ſubject of. That Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have an exiſtence, have not a reſpective exiſtence to thee, is from the Lord's mercy. <hi>Moſes</hi> notes this in his ſpeech to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> Deut. 7. 15. <hi>And the Lord will take away</hi>

                     <p>2. Look more to God, and leſs to the Creatures, when they give not down their Milk.

                     <p>3. Bleſs God for Negative Mercies. If the Lord were not the cauſe why things are not, what had been your caſe in regard of miſeries? All the temporal evils inflicted on others, are <hi>Memorandums</hi> for thy thankfulneſs. The Lord's withholding Satan from falling in on thee with this or that temptation, at ſuch a nick of time, doth call for thy acknowledgment.

Why things are, and conſequently are not, in regard of their continued beeings: for if God with-hold his influences, the Creatures are <hi>a nigrum nihil,</hi> an empty nothing: this in v. 30. <hi>Thou ſended forth thy ſpirit, they are created: and thou reneweſt the face of the earth.</hi> (2.) Why things are not, in regard of their operations. The Water is a fluid body, and would quickly diffuſe it ſelf: And why not? <hi>Thou haſt ſet a bound, that they</hi> (the Waters) <hi>may not paſs over, that they turn not again to cover the earth,</hi> v. 9. (3.) Why things are not in ſuch a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The beaſts of prey are not ordinarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad when man is: this in v. 22, 23. <hi>the Sun ariſeth, they gather themſelves together, and lay them down in their dens: man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</hi> (4.) VVhy things are no longer in regard of duration or time for their exiſtencies. This we have in v. 29. <hi>Thou hideſt thy face, they are troubled: thou takeſt away their breath, they dye and return to their duſt.</hi>

                     <p>4. God is All wiſe, and therefore ſecond-thoughts are not better with him. He being infinite VViſdom, there can be no addition to His Underſtanding.

God doth often threaten, not that what is threatned is to take place, but the contrary; the threatning being a ſanctified means as the Lord ordereth it.

                     <p>2. How otherwiſe were there ſuch ground for admiration, if the Lord had not His Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets or Depths to be admired? If there were no knots to unty, how could it be ſo ſaid, <hi>O the finger of God?</hi> The Angels are ſaid to <hi>cover their faces with their wings,</hi> Iſa. 6. 2 <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledg of God! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. 11. 33. Here by the way let it be noted, That if ſo skilful a Pilot as <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>O the depth!</hi> ſhall ſuch who may be ſcarce reckoned common Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt-men, pretend to find out a North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt paſſage, a new way in the Decrees of God, and the <hi>Providence</hi> of God; and ſuch a way, as that it may be ſaid, <hi>Behold the Plains according to their model;</hi> which yet is a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, where they loſe themſelves; and whilſt they labour to Tinker up one hole, they make two.</p>
                     <p>3. The Scripture plainly aſſerts, how it is the glory of God to conceal a thing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 2. For the better underſtanding of this place, I ſhall annex what pious and judicious <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> ſaith: <q rend="inline">God verily is to be honoured, inaſmuch as he hath revealed his counſel and will in many things. But ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdom of Heaven, whoſe cauſes and reaſons are unſearchable, yield to him the richer crop of honour; ſuch are the Myſteries of the Trinity; The three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diſtinction of Perſons in one Eſſence; The eternal generation of the Son; The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101303:63"/> proceſſion of the Holy Spirit; The eternal predeſtination of ſome to life, others to death; The incarnation of the Son of God; or the aſſumption of our frail fleſh into the unity of his Perſon: Of God, all things whatſoever are done, both decreeing, and his <hi>Providence</hi> ſo ruling, that out of the evil which is done, he contracts no guilt: Of Parents ſins to be puniſht on poſterity to many generations: Of juſt judgment to be executed by the unjuſt: Of the burning of the Wife for the Husband's ſin, and the Children for the Parents, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 25.</q> Of which, and all ſuch kind, it may be truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, They do each afford to men a large field of praiſing and glorifying God; yea, he is the more amply, and with fuller mouth in theſe to be extolled, than in other matters, whoſe cauſes and principles with our minds and underſtanding we do in ſome meaſure take in: for firſt of all, it is apparent from hence, That God's Wiſdom is infinite and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Creature: Moreover, That God is to be believed upon his own teſtimony, and according to his pleaſure may do whatever he will; and ſo far condeſcends from his right, when he vouchſafeth to render a reaſon of his doings or ſayings.</p>
                     <p>That though the Lord hath his Secrets, Depths; yet he is never unjuſt in his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. The Lord hath his Throne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judicature; <hi>The judgment was ſet, and the books were opened,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> beheld in that Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, chap. 7. 10.

So that Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 16, 17, 22. (2.) That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering who the Lord is; He, whoſe Will as

                     <p>2. In the conveyance of the means of grace to ſome, and not ſo to others. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgments unto Iſrael: he hath not dealt ſo with any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and as for his judgments, they have not known them; praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 147. 19, 20. And this is not only Old-Teſtament Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but alſo New; the Lord directs <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> where, and where not, they are to preach the Goſpel. <hi>Now when they had gone thoroughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghoſt to preach the word in Aſia, after they were come to Myſia, they aſſayed to go into Bythinia, but the Spirit ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them not: and they paſſing by Myſia, came down to Troas; and a viſion appeared to Paul in the night: there ſtood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, ſaying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us: and after we had ſeen the viſion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, aſſuredly gathering, that the Lord had called us for to preach the Goſpel unto them,</hi> Acts 16. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. In conferring gifts and endowments on ſome, and not on others. All are not alike ſubjects of ſuch and ſuch qualifications. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> propheſieth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. <hi>Ahitophel</hi> is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Oracle for wiſdom and counſel in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 23. <hi>Many will ſay to Chriſt in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name done many wonderful works,</hi> Mat. 7. 22. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, That ſome, like Lead, may have a very ſpecious ſtamp of ſome gifts, and yet be Lead ſtill, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2.</p>

                     <p>4. In planting ſaving-grace in the hearts of ſome, not ſo in the hearts of others. <hi>It is given unto you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Diſciples) <hi>to know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven; and to them it is not given,</hi> Mat. 13. 11. Our Saviour ſpeaks of two ſorts of branches, ſome fruit-bearing ones, others not ſo, <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. The Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> doth tacitly diſtinguiſh of profeſſors, when he ſaith, <hi>But beloved, we are perſwaded better things of you, and things that accompany ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Heb. 6. 9.</p>
                     <p>5. In calling home by his grace ſome at one time of their life, and in a different way in point of circumſtances, others not ſo. Some, their ſhip arriveth ſooner at the Port of Grace, and are brought in with gentle gales; others after a long courſing up and down, meet with rough winds, and ſo are landed at laſt. <hi>Joſiah, Jeremiah, John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, Timothy,</hi> may ſerve as inſtances on the one part: <hi>Manaſſeh, Paul,</hi> with others, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifications on the other. Some are ſweetly won into the Vinyard; others are driven, and (as it were) hunted in, and at different ſeaſons: for we read of the morning, the third hour, the ſixth, ninth, and eleventh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>6. In giving larger meaſures of grace to ſome, not ſo to others. Some are ſmoaking flax, and bruiſed reeds, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 20. Others grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth their rootslike <hi>Lebanon;</hi> their branches ſpread, and their beauty is as the Olive-tree, and their ſmell as <hi>Lebanon, Hoſ.</hi> 14. 6, 7. <hi>John</hi> rangeth Chriſtians into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101303:68"/> children, fathers, and young-men, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 12, 13. Why they who are the children, are not the young men; the young men the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and why the fathers are not the young men, and young men the children, the one in one place, the others in the other; is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamly from the Soveraign Will of God, who could have wrought otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>7. In carrying on ſome in their journey heavenward, without ſuch falls by the way as others have had. <hi>David, Jonah, Peter,</hi> did ſplinter their bones, though they brake not their necks: they fell into the mire, though they wallowed not in it as ſwine of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Herd. We do not find that <hi>Paul,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had ſuch plunges after their primitive or firſt acquaintance with Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>nothing by my ſelf; yet am I not hereby juſtified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 4.</p>
                     <p>8. In landing ſome at the Port of Heaven, as it were, with top and top-gallant, pennents ſtreaming, and flags flying: They go out of the world triumphantly; they are in Heaven before they are in Heaven: a ſight they have of the Beatifical Viſion, on earth. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen being full of the Holy Ghoſt, looked up ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly into beaven, and ſaw the glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding on the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7. 55, 56. Others, though they may have as much of inherent grace, yea ſometimes more, yet go out of the world in a cloud, though not in a ſtinking ſnuff. Chriſt himſelf, upon the Deity's ſuſpenſion of his operation, goes off the ſtage of the world with a <hi>My God, my</hi>

                     <p>2. In Temporals, or matters referring to this life, the Lord's Soveraign Will is diſplayed.</p>
                     <p>1. In giving ſuch a beeing for kind. That the Efficiency of God was not otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in regard of the object, at ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or in ſome other way, as <hi>Adam</hi> was made out of the duſt of the earth, <hi>Eve</hi> not ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but out of a rib of <hi>Adam,</hi> is from the Lord, who acts as he pleaſeth. It was replied by the weeping Shepherd to the two Cardinals going to the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and demanding of the Shepherd why he was ſo pathetical? <hi>I admire</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord, that I was not made as yonder Toad. Job</hi> takes notice of the Lord's <hi>Providence</hi> in his beeing, and the mode of it, ſaying, <hi>Haſt thou not pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me out like milk, and crudled me as cheeſe? thou haſt clothed me with skin and fleſh, and haſt fenced me with bones and ſinews: thou haſt grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me life and favour; and thy viſitation hath preſerved my ſpirit,</hi> Job 10. 10, 11, 12.</p>

There is a wiſe ſoveraign lot of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in God's diſpoſal of parties to their reſpective places of abode. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation,</hi> Acts 17. 26. Some in regard of places for accommodation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the outward man, or inward, or both, may ſay, <hi>The lines are fallen unto me in pleaſant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16. 6.</p>

                     <p>6. In giving to ſome ſuch and ſuch Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>When Eſau lifted up his eyes, and ſaw the women and children, Who are theſe with thee, ſaith he to Jacob? and he ſaid, The children which God hath graciouſly given thy ſervant,</hi> Gen.

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:101303:71"/>
                     <p>1. The influences that Soveraignty hath had on Saints in Scripture, are recorded to this end and purpoſe, That others ſhould write after ſo good Copies. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 18. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it,</hi> Pſal. 39. 9.</p>
                     <p>2. God's Soveraignty caſts its particular aſpects on the graces of Chriſtians. As there is Soveraign Juſtice, ſo there is Soveraign Mercy, and each beſpeak the exerciſe of grace according to the nature of the diſpenſation. More particularly, there are theſe Graces, on which (as on the Chriſtians Garden) Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty (like the North-wind and South-wind) may blow, that the Spices thereof may come forth; to allude to that in <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                     <p>1. A ſweet ſubmiſſion of ſpirit, in oppoſition to our own judgment, or preſcribing to God. <hi>The will of the Lord be done,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 14.</p>
                     <p>2. Contentation, in oppoſition to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at our own condition, and envy at others who may have more gifts of the mind high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degrees of graces, or more of the good things of this life, than we have. That is a remarkable paſſage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15. <hi>Is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becauſe mine is good?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Hopefulneſs of ſpirit under the greateſt diſtreſſes, whether outward or inward. May not God exalt Soveraign Mercy? Are there dry bones? yet may they not live? <hi>Ezek</hi> 37.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101303:71"/> 12, 13. Is the heart as low as Hell in regard of fears, ſorrows, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> yet will not he who dwelleth in the higheſt Heavens, take up his habitation in the loweſt heart? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>4. Love and thankfulneſs; and that (1.) with reſpect to ſmiling-diſpenſations, whether they reſpect ſoul or body. <hi>Who am I, Lord,</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi> upon a view of his mercies)? <hi>and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> 1 Chron. 17. 16.

With reſpect to frowning ones: That there is any mitigation and ſanctification of them, is ground of love and thankfulneſs: for God might have exalted Juſtice to its height in thy afflictive-diſpenſarions. <hi>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not conſumed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his compaſſions fail not,</hi> Lam. 3. 22.</p>

Was it not diſcontent at the Lord's Diſpenſation? <hi>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not reſpect: and Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell,</hi> Gen. 4. 5. (2.) Whoſe judgment ſhall take place in matters? the Lord's, who is infallible, righteous, ſupream? or man's, who is made up of wants and weakneſſes? <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>it is ſo of a truth: but how ſhould man be juſt with God? if he will contend with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand,</hi> Job 9. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>2. Exerciſe graces proper to be exerciſed, with reſpect to God's Soveraignty. Let the holding up of the finger of Soveraignty, huſh all noiſe, and quicken you to your Leſſon. <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord,</hi> Zech. 2, 13. Conſider here three things:</p>
                     <p>1. Is there any rational ground for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary carriage? <hi>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder? who will ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> Job 9. 12.</p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:101303:72"/>
                     <p>2. <hi>Go down to the potter's houſe,</hi> Jer. 18. 2, 3, 4. And what may you learn there? Is not the Clay ductile, pliable, obediential, to the hand of the Potter? And ſhould not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian labour more and more to have his Will moulded or faſhioned to the Will of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in point of holy ſubmiſſions? <hi>Carry back</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Zadock</hi>) <hi>the Ark of God into the City: if I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it and his habitation: but if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee; behold here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good to him,</hi> 2 Sam. 15. 25, 26.</p>
                     <p>3. The way to have God to be gracious, is to exerciſe grace with reſpect to the Lord's Soveraignty to be diſplayed as he pleaſeth. There is a way of order, though not of merit; a way of our Duty, though God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times notably exalt Soveraign Mercy when duty is neglected. <hi>The Iſraelites provoked God at the ſea, even at the red-ſea; nevertheleſs he ſaved them for his Name's ſake, that he might make his mighty power to be known,</hi> Pſal. 106. 7, 8. And though this be ſo, yet men have no ground to neglect their duty. <hi>Job</hi> his captivity is turned, and God exalteth kindneſs to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; yet <hi>Job</hi> is reaſoned firſt into an holy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſenſe of his failings; ſee <hi>Job</hi> 42.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>3. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101303:73"/> exceeding greatneſs of his Power, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                     <p>2. As conjoined with Wiſdom. According to this Conſideration, in regard of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, God's Power is glorious in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters to paſs. <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdom,</hi> Job 36. 5. <hi>Wiſdom and might are his,</hi> Dan. 2. 20. It is ſaid, That, in Warlike affairs, <hi>Policy ſurpaſſeth Power:</hi> What cannot then both infinite Power and Wiſdom accompliſh, though the Wiſdom of <hi>Myriads</hi> of <hi>Achitophels,</hi> aſſay the contrary!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Power of God in regard of Human Power, will appear the more tranſcendent, if it be conſidered,</p>
                     <p>1. That Human Power is derivative, or borrowed from Him who is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a great Monarch, he had Kings ſubordinate to him; yet ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> to him, <hi>Thou, O king, art king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and ſtrength, and glory,</hi> Dan. 2. 37. All <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Power wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but a Slip taken out of Heaven's Garden. He was beholding to God, who placed not only the Crown upon his Head, but his Head alſo upon his Shoulders. And not only the Power, but the exerciſe of it alſo, is mutatitious, or borrowed. So Chriſt to <hi>Pilate, Thou couldſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above,</hi> John 19. 10. But,</p>
                     <p>2. The Power of God is ſeen as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in compare with Human Power; in that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101303:74"/> the Lord can, and doth, when he pleaſeth, dethrone the greateſt Potentates of the World. How quickly is a <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the Palace to the Park, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 32. <hi>God is Judg, he putteth down the one, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up another,</hi> Pſal. 75. 7. And hence <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpeaking of the two Kings, <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> whom God had cauſed to fall before his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 21. annexeth a pertinent deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Power, ſaying, <hi>O Lord God, thou haſt begun to ſhew thy ſervant thy greatneſs, and thy mighty hand; for what God is there in heaven, or in earth, that can do according thy works, and according to thy might?</hi> v. 24.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Power of God is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in regard of the manner of its diſplay; and that three ways:</p>
                     <p>1. Immediately, or without means. If there be wanting means, yet there is never wanting power to bring about matters, where and when God pleaſeth, without means. He that made the World without a Tool, can act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Inſtrument. If there be not an human arm to cruſh a <hi>Laban,</hi> yet there is not wanting an hand from Heaven to reſtrain him: ſo he acknowledgeth, ſaying, <hi>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father ſpake unto me yeſternight, ſaying, Take thou heed that thou ſpeak not to Jacob either good or bad,</hi> Gen. 31. 29.</p>
                     <p>2. Mediately, by means; and theſe though weak and improbable. God checkt Egyptian-inſolency by Frogs and Lice. The blowing of the Trumpets of Rams-horns, is as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101303:74"/> to level the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> as if a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand barrels of Gun-powder had been mined in under them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Gideon</hi> with his Three hundred men, routeth the Army of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> as well as if his Army had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of Three hundred thouſand, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtles, being delegated by Chriſt to the preaching of the Goſpel, what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are drawn into Chriſt by them? who were to confront the world in that work, as it was then adjudged, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 21. &amp; 17 6. &amp; 24. 14.</p>
                     <p>3. Contrary to the nature of means is the Power of God diſplayed. He made the fluid Waters to ſtand up as a ſolid Wall for his people to paſs by, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 22. Fire ſhall flame, and not burn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 26. Lions ſhall be hungry, and yet not devour a <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 6. 22, 23. An harſh and cruel Jaylor to a <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> ſhall become all kindneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 23, 24, 33.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Power of God in regard of the extent of it, hath its conſideration. <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>a mighty arm: ſtrong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand,</hi> Pſal. 89. 13. <hi>With God all things are poſſible,</hi> Mar. 10. 27. <hi>For with God nothing ſhall be impoſſible,</hi> Luke 1. 37. And not only in the general is the Power of God marvellous, but likewiſe more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, if we view it with reſpect to,
<list>
                           <item>1. Spirituals.</item>
                           <item>2. Temporals.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The former, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>—the exceeding greatneſs of his</hi>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:101303:75"/> 
                        <hi>power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> As the Power of God was richly diſplayed in making the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth; ſo likewiſe is it in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the new Heavens and new Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. Look we into the new World, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a golden thread of Power is drawn thorow theſe following Pearls.</p>
                     <p>1. Converſion-work, regeneration, or the new-creature, declareth the Power of God. <hi>Thy people ſhall be a willing people in the day of thy power,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. That the Wolf dwells with the Lamb, and Leopard lies down with the Kid, is from the Power of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>2. The forgiving of ſin, and the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it more and more, do likewiſe hold forth the <hi>Encomiums</hi> and Praiſes of God's Power. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy: he will turn again, he will have compaſſion upon us: he will ſubdue our iniquities; and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea,</hi> Mic. 7. 18, 19. <hi>But that ye may know</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Scribes) <hi>that the Son of Man hath power to forgive ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 9. 16. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14.</p>
                     <p>3. The raiſing up of parties to a ſenſe of God's love, eſpecially after a ſpiritual languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falls, ſlips, conflicts with their darkneſs
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101303:75"/> and cloudineſs of ſpirit; doth beſpeak the Power of God in ſo doing. <hi>Create in me a clean heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>), <hi>and renew a right ſpirit within me; reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Pſal. 51. 10, 12. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace,</hi> Iſa. 57. 19.</p>
                     <p>4. The vigorous ſuſtentation of parties in the exerciſe of graces under ſufferings, doth proclaim the Power of God. <hi>Be not thou</hi> (writes <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>) <hi>therefore aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his priſoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, according to the power of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 8. See more, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 8, 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                     <p>5. The conflict of Saints with Satan, doth witneſs the Power of God. <hi>The God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16. 20. The Devil is a roaring Lion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and yet he is not an irreſiſtable Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for <hi>v.</hi> 9. it is ſaid, <hi>Whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the fuith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Perſeverance in grace, even unto glory, doth exhibit a large teſtimonial of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God; ſo 1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. In the next place, The Power of God is ſeen in Temporals. What is the World but an Hall hung with this Cloath of Arras? We may behold the Power of God in the meaneſt or leaſt of Creatures. Amongſt other things, obſerve the ſparklings of this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in two things.</p>

                     <p>1. In point of Proviſion for parties: How did God feed ſo many thouſand, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and in a Wilderneſs, of old! See <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2, 3, 4. As the Power of God was then ſeen, ſo it is ſeen in a larger Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the whole World, in feeding the ſons of men, as ſhall after be ſpoken unto; and the ſame Power of God is ſeen as it reſpects per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, families, in their particular Wilderneſs. But,</p>
                     <p>2. In point of Protection, notwithſtanding dangers. It would fill a Volume to rehearſe the many remarkable preſervations which ſome have had, whilſt the Lord had wiſe Ends ſubordinate to his glory, for their exiſtence here in the world. It may ſuffice that Chriſt points out the Power of God in preſerving, when he ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Behold I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of wolves,</hi> Mat. 10. 16. What a notable draught have we of the Power of God in the reſcue of <hi>Peter</hi> (one of the Church's Bell-weathers) from the Paw of that Lion <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12. Neither Quaternions of Soldiers, nor Chains, nor Iron-gate, ſhall hold him whom God will ſet free. It is a truth, <hi>God</hi>'s Peters <hi>are immortal till their work be done.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. THERE is no ground to be deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or dejected in and under trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Deſpondency of ſpirit is an evil of ſin, which ſteals in on parties under their evil of ſmart. <hi>David ſaid in his heart, I ſhall now periſh one day by the hand of Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 27. 1. and yet <hi>Saul</hi>'s day of death was then nearer, and <hi>David</hi> lived to ſee the day, for a confutation of his black imaginations; for ſo is it recorded 2 Sam. 22. 1. <hi>And David ſpake unto the Lord the words of this ſong in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.</hi> Let not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian then be ſinking under his <hi>Saul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> like diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but ask his ſoul this queſtion, Can I find out an Omnipotent Diſtreſs? If my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſay, nay; and tell me there is but one Omnipotent in the World; Why doth my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected practice ſay, yea? or tacitly proclaim the contrary?</p>
                     <p>2. Diſtruſt not the truth of God's word, as if the Lord could not be as good as his word for defect of Power. 'Twas <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s fault, that he look't too much to Second-cauſes, and did not conſider, as he ſhould, the Power of God, which had Nature (though decayed) at his beck, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 19, 20. If therefore there be as great an unlikelihood of things ſpoken of in Scripture, in point of being fulfilled, as there was that <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101303:77"/> old, ſhould have a ſon; yet give no way to cavilling-unbelief; but take a view of matters in conjunction with the Power of God; and ſo indeed we are taught in Scripture, as in the caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who have lien in a forlorn eſtate for ſo many Centuries of years. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>God is able to graff them in again.</hi> And ſo likewiſe in the caſe of Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>Therefore ſhall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and ſhe ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly burnt with fire: for ſtrong is the Lord who judgeth her.</hi> And ſo in any other difficult caſe, let that be remembred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>Is there any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Be encouraged to go on in ſuch work as God calleth you unto in his <hi>Providence.</hi> He that hath a God of Power to ſet him on work, and pay him wages, may take the more encouragement to follow his work. If God be with <hi>Moſes,</hi> as he promiſeth, ſaying, <hi>Certainly I will be with thee,</hi> Exod. 3. 12. <hi>Moſes</hi> may take heart notwithſtanding all blocks in the way. Heaven's Warrant will bear God's <hi>Moſeſes</hi> out, notwithſtanding all the fury of the ſons of the earth, and the ſons of hell too: See <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 6, 7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>4. Reſolve on the exerciſe of faith more and more on the Power of God. Let not ſo glorious a Jewel lye by, without taking fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent views of it by the eye of Faith. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two things:</p>
                     <p>1. Hereby you glorifie God, in giving him a due eſtimate of his Power. A clear and full
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101303:77"/> exemplification for this, we have in <hi>Abraham, who being not weak in faith, conſidered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old; neither yet the deadneſs of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah's womb; he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief: but was ſtrong in faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving glory to God, and being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform,</hi> Rom. 4. 19, 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>2. Hereby you conſult your own good and quiet. Had men more of Faith, they would have leſs of diſquiet. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled; ye believe in God, believe alſo in me;</hi> was a word ſpoken in ſeaſon by Chriſt for the calming of the hearts of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid here, <hi>I queſtion not the Power of God.</hi> It may be replied,</p>
                     <p>1. It is well if you do not; as good as you have had their reflections on the Power of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> queſtions how Six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot-men ſhould be provided for fleſh for a Month in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 21, 22. God tells him, ſaying, <hi>Is the Lord's hand waxed ſhort? thou ſhalt ſee now whether my words ſhall come to paſs unto thee, or no, v.</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p>2. Is there not a deceit of heart here? God's Will is pretended, but is not the Power of God queſtioned? A reaſon to evidence this, is thus: Becauſe when the diſtreſs is greater, the party is the more diſquieted. Diſquiet riſeth with the difficulty. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the Red-ſea were made up of unbelief, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14 11, 12. They might have conſidered, that the Power
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101303:78"/> of God, which had made a paſſage through <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his ſtony heart for their egreſs from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> could make a paſſage for them through the Red-ſea. <hi>Martha</hi> is queſtioning the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of her brother, though Chriſt had ſaid the word for the encouragement of faith; and what is that which ſtaggereth her faith? it is becauſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been dead four days; ſee <hi>John</hi> 11. 39, 40.</p>
                     <p>3. In reference to the Will of God about matters, that there ſhall be no defect on God's part. What he promiſeth abſolutely, ſhall be made good; what conditionally, is made good likewiſe; yea, not only when the Condition is performed on our part, but ſometimes when failing on our part: as in <hi>Martha</hi> her caſe; Chriſt had told her, If ſhe believed, ſhe ſhould ſee the glory of God diſplayed, <hi>John</hi> 11. 40. yet ſhe queſtioneth, as <hi>v.</hi> 39. and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> is raiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 44. True then is that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23. <hi>Faithful is he who hath promiſed.</hi>

                        </note> ſeems to ſit ſtill, will be evidenced,</p>
                     <p>1. From poſitive aſſertions in Scripture. So Prov. 15. 3. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> Eyes here are attributed to God, to note not only his knowledg of, or inſpection into the affairs of the World; but his wiſe ordering of all things, in all places, and at all times: for theſe eyes are never ſhut; the Lord is not a ſleepy Watchman: <hi>Behold, he that keepeth Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep,</hi> Pſal. 121. 4. <hi>My Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Jews, who were ſtumbled at the Miracle wrought on the Sabbath-day) <hi>worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> Joh. 5. 17. The ſenſe is, Though God reſted the ſeventh day from his work of Creation; yet he hath not been at reſt ever ſince; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually worketh hitherto in his <hi>Providence;</hi> and yet none of you durſt entitle Him a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101303:79"/> of your Sabbath; and why then am I adjudged a violater for a doing my Father's work. This I conceive, with others, to be the intendment of that place of Scripture; and it plainly giveth to underſtand, that God's Providential care in and over the World, is permanent. The Lord withdraws not his manu-tenency; <hi>He upholds all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>2. From exemplifications in Scripture. For if we caſt an eye on this or that ſpecial draught of <hi>Providence,</hi> we may trace the foot-ſteeps of the Almighty even there, where we cannot ſee Him ſo viſibly walk for a time. Draughts of <hi>Providence</hi> are of two ſorts:</p>
                     <p>1. Some reſpect perſons ſingly, as in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s and <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe.</p>
                     <p>2. Others reſpect parties collectively, or the Body of a people, a Community of a people, as the Church of God in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in times of the New-Teſtament under perſecution. Whoſo ſhall take a right view of the caſes of Saints thus inſtanced in, will find the reſult to be commenſurate to the Truth aſſerted. He who diggeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for an houſe, the deeper he digs, the leſs viſible he is to thoſe who caſt an eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place where the digging-work is managed; and whilſt this work is on foot, Is nothing done, or doing, becauſe the ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls are not reared, and tile-ſtones are not hung? There is a manifold working-hand of <hi>Providence.</hi> God doth ripen perſons for mercies, and mercies for perſons. There is not only a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101303:79"/> work of the Shoo-maker, whereby a Shoo is made of this or that proportion; but there is a work of the Phyſician, whereby the ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, hydropical foot is reduced to its regular ſhape, and is fitted for the ſhoo. If God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome diſpenſations carry on a work upon us, though he do not this or that work for us, till he ſee fit, he is ſtill at work; and the work he intends, is in its Second-cauſes; it is latent there, and comes forth from between the Curtains of antecedent preparations, when the Lord's time is come. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are in <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Furnace, where they muſt be melted; and the hotter the Furnace is, the nearer <hi>Moſes</hi> is with his Pails of water to extinguiſh the <hi>Egyptian</hi> fires, though the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> know no ſuch matter: ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 23, 24. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. v. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Job</hi> in like ſort is put into Heaven's Mortar, where he is pounded and beaten, to the end the ſweet fragor or ſmell of his graces might come forth: and after God hath taught him many a good leſſon, a proſperous condition is on the hand-gallop towards him; it had its foot in the ſtirrop before; he had friends, they were not impoveriſh't as <hi>Job</hi> was; they had hands to help, and have hearts to help or ſet up a broken man in his eſtate, when the time for ſo doing is come; <hi>Every man alſo gave him a piece of money, and every one an earing of gold,</hi> Job 42. 11.</p>
                     <p>And we have not only exemplifications of Saints, but likewiſe of Sinners; and that both ſingly conſidered, as well as in a Body
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101303:80"/> or Community. Sinners ripen for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Judgments ripen for Sinners. They, by their ſinning, are digging their own graves with their own nails. The pit is a digging for them, though it be not quite finiſht: there is an [<hi>until the pit be digged for the wicked,</hi> Pſal. 94. 13.] What a Bogg or Quag-mire then do ſinners dance on! the ſurface or top-turf breaks, and what becomes of them, with their inſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, projects, deſigns? <hi>Then ſhe that is mine enemy</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>ſhall ſee it, and ſhame ſhall cover her, which ſaid unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? Mine eyes ſhall behold her: now ſhall ſhe be trodden down as the mire of the ſtreets,</hi> Mic. 7. 10.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101303:80"/> to that object-matter which the Lord to our apprehenſion ſeems to forget, and lies dormant: for there is a promoting-work of <hi>Providence,</hi> which we ſee not, and are not ſo ſenſible of for the preſent, as hath been ſhewed, and may further be ſhewed in the next Obſervation. Beſides, ſuch forgetting and ſleep of <hi>Providence,</hi> as it is ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks the beauty of <hi>Providence</hi> in the way of bringing things to paſs. It is ſo far from inferring an <hi>inter-regnum,</hi> or letting fall the Scepter of Government, as that it is a glorious demonſtration that God orders matters, and that wiſely, whilſt he ſeems to forget, and be as one aſleep. As the Night, as night, falls under the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, as well as the Day; for there are the Ordinances of Heaven for the Night-ſeaſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 35. ſo the dark Night, when as to matters the Lord ſeems to ſleep, is reductive to His All-wiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Government. The Seventy-years Captivity was a long Night of the Church's diſtreſs; and yet thus it muſt be according to Ordinance of <hi>Providence, Jer.</hi> 29. 10.</p>

                     <p>1. From the ſecret and inviſible agency of Angels, about that work which <hi>Providence</hi> in time brings forth on the ſtage. The living Creatures are ſaid to have the hands of men under their wings, on their four ſides, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 8. Hands are the inſtruments for action; and theſe are vailed over with wings. Theſe hands are at work, though men ſee them not. And thus the Angel informs <hi>Daniel</hi> how he had been hard at work in the Court of <hi>Perſia,</hi> though <hi>Daniel</hi> knew no ſuch matter, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>2. From ſome under-ground foundation laid of matters. There is a ſeed ſown, but it is yet under the clods. Little doth mortal eye
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101303:82"/> ſee how <hi>Providence</hi> will bring both the ſticks ends together, which at preſent lies ſtraight.

And this leads to the next particular.</p>
                     <p>2. In regard of Time: It is ſuppoſed that

                     <p>1. FROM God's doing ſomething, whilſt he doth nothing, Learn,</p>
                     <p>1. To do ſomething, by doing nothing againſt God. Let not the ſilence of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> be an occaſion of crying-ſins. That ſervant who ſaid in his heart, <hi>My Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth his coming;</hi> and began to beat the Man-ſervants and Maidens, and to eat, and to drink, and to be drunken; was cut in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 45, 46. And,</p>
                     <p>2. As to do nothing againſt God; ſo to do ſomething poſitively for God, to His glory, and in obedience to Him. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth perſons under ſuch a poſition of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Providence,</hi> to conſider of their ſins, to be humbled for them, turn from them, and ſo ſweetly to wait the iſſues of <hi>Providence. Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 50. 3. and what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is made of that aſſertive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, you may ſee, (1.) By way of terror to thoſe who abuſe the ſilence of <hi>Providence,</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Now conſider this, ye that forget God,</hi>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:101303:84"/>

By way of implicit Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conſolation, to ſuch who keep cloſe to God, in the way of holy walking with Him, and before Him, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Whoſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth praiſe, glorifieth me: and to him that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. From God's doing nothing, whilſt men are in expectation of great matters to be done: Learn,</p>
                     <p>1. What reaſon there is for men to look to the ground of their Expectations. To expect other-what, other-when, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the Lord hath purpoſed, or made ſome diſcovery of ſuch a purpoſe, is to build Caſtles in the air, not in the Heavens; and what hath not its foundation in Heaven, as the Lord is the Founder of it, will not have its ſuperſtruction on Earth. <hi>For ever, O Lord, thy word is ſeated in heaven,</hi> Pſal. 119. 89. <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs, when the Lord commandeth it not,</hi> Lament. 3. 37.</p>
                     <p>2. In the ſecond place, Learn from hence to view the folly of wicked men's purpoſes, preſumptions, deſigns, in their proſecution and perſecution of the Saints of God. O how often are they diſappointed! The greedy Dogs often catch not the morſel; and when they do, they vomit it up again. They pay deer for their luſt here, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Hell. They have their gnaſhing of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101303:84"/> teeth in regard of diſappointments, before they gnaſh them in the other World. <hi>Herod,</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> will murder <hi>Peter;</hi> the Lamb is taken, but not to be ſlain till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Paſsover; and not then: <hi>for now I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>of a ſurety, that the Lord hath ſent his Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people of the Jews,</hi> Acts 12. 12.

                     <p>2.

                     </p>
                     <p>3. There are clear exemplifications of this adaptation or connexion, (1.) In Naturals: ſo in the place mentioned, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 21, 22. ſo <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. (2.) In Civils: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are to rule, and people to be ruled, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. And where it is not ſo, there is an adaptation of things in way of puniſhment, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 6. (3.) In Sacreds: There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted order in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And not only is there an adapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this way, but likewiſe in regard of the means of Grace, and Grace by the means. A connexion there is, but yet arbitrary, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of God, when, and to whom Grace is conveyed by the Means. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts a connexion, when he thus ſtateth the matter, ſaying, <hi>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 17.</p>
                     <p>4. This adaptation or connexion may be more particularly evidenced, if we caſt an eye,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101303:86"/>
                        <list>

                     </p>
                     <p>1. There is an adaptation in regard of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments miniſterial. In the ſhop of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> there are tools of all ſorts and ſizes. If the Lord will puniſh the Nations, he can find an Hammer to knock them down. <hi>Thou art my battel-ax and weapons of warr, for with thee will I break in pieces the nations,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 51. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the day of viſitation be come for an <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Family, and <hi>Baal</hi>'s worſhippers: there is a <hi>Jehu,</hi> a rough Captain-General, who drives furiouſly, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 20. If God will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe good days to a people, he can raiſe up Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Shepherds, ſuch as <hi>David,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulneſs of his hands,</hi> Pſal. 78. 72. And as there is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daptation in regard of Political Inſtruments, ſo likewiſe in regard of Eccleſiaſtical. There is a zealous <hi>Elijah</hi> in times of apoſtacy and declining from God's Worſhip; and a <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> of whom the Angel ſaith, <hi>He ſhall go before him</hi> (i. e. Chriſt) <hi>in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord,</hi> Luke 1. 17. There is an admirable adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in the Church's having not only <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs, John Baptiſts,</hi> but likewiſe others,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101303:86"/> whoſe endowments are uſeful to confute Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, as <hi>Apollos, Acts</hi> 15. 28. and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort diſtreſſed, and build up ſouls in practical way of converſe with God. See <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                     <p>2. There is an adaptation, or ſuiting of things in regard of occaſions, or kind of in lets into this or that. Both the ſon's and father's diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, are inducements to <hi>Jacob</hi> to mind a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 1, 2. A report ſounds in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s ears, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled; probably he conceived the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to flye like Hares, ſuch who might eaſily be hunted back again to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> and ſo is himſelf thruſt on to his own ruin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>David</hi> his good ſervice done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath an influence on the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to bring them to <hi>Hebron: Alſo,</hi> ſay they, <hi>in time paſt, when Saul was King over us, thou waſt he that leddeſt out and broughteſt in Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 5.</p>
                     <p>3. There is an adaptation or connexion of Means in order to this or that which comes to paſs. And that as the Means are proper or ſuitable in order to the End intended, as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s Ark is proper to prevent drowning by the Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 14. or as the Means are not ſo proper in order to the End intended by the Agent, though proper and effectual to bring about what the Lord righteouſly had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.

                     <p>1. TAKE notice of an Argument to prove <hi>Providence,</hi> from the adaptation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of things. The admirable adaption of matters, may ſilence Atheiſtical cavils. It is ſaid of <hi>Galen,</hi> That upon the view of the wonderful adaptation and connexion of the parts in a Body defected, he was much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, pens a Tract in commendation of the Author of Nature. What then may be obſerved in the little World MAN, as he is termed by ſome; may as well be obſerved in <note place="margin">Item, ſi nulla Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia ſit, quomodo animali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora tam provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter ordinata ſunt, ut ſingula quae<expan>

The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the wonderful diſpoſition of things, <hi>Pſal</hi> 4. he begins and concludes with an <hi>O Lord, our Lord! how excellent is thy Name in all the earth!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Learn what to judg of Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or of this or that which happeneth in a buſineſs. Theſe are links in the Chain of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> They are Scouts of Heaven's Army, though we are apt to look on them as ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. In the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> it may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how the brethren took occaſion from the dreams to malign him; they had him now off from his Father's Houſe, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> is a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man in the Pit, his Priſon; and whilſt there,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101303:88"/> the <hi>Midianites</hi> paſs by, and they Merchants, who did not it ſeems ſcruple the bargain, but gave Twenty pieces of ſilver for him. Here is an adaptation of Agents, Occaſions, Means, Opportunity, and all concurr to bring about what the Lord had wiſely and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly determined. The Dreams were now on Horſe-back in order to fulfilling, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> is poſted away to <hi>Egypt.</hi> All theſe Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, like the ſheafs in the Dream, do obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to <hi>Providence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Reſolve, by way of Moral practiſe, on an adaptation or connexion of your duty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture, with the good End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. If you would go to Heaven, turn not your backs upon the path which leads thither. Holineſs is the road-way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>without it, no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 13. 14. <hi>He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. The man will be found a fooliſh build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who builds on the ſand, not on a rock; ſo teacheth our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24, 25, 26, 27. Moreover, in reference to Civil Affairs, a connexion is there to be obſerved: <hi>—An honeſt Calling is to be followed honeſtly. A man muſt keep his ſhop, if he would have his ſhop keep him. The Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to poverty; and drowſineſs ſhall clothe a man with rags,</hi> Prov. 23. 21.</p>
                     <p>4. Meditate on the rich diſplay of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes in the adaptation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of things. Here is a large field for an <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s walk. <hi>Iſaac;</hi> who went out into the field to meditate, might ſee, and did after
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101303:88"/> hear a ſtory of a wonderful adaptation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Marriage-journey, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. The adaptations or connexions of things here to be meditated on, are not only perſonal, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Lord's ordering our particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, how he provides, protects, directs, ſupports, and the like; but alſo publick. There are National adaptations or connexions of things, in which God's glory doth ſhine forth. Theſe the godly heretofore have noted, as in <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. there is a large Catalogue there of ſuch adaptations and connexions. The Book of <hi>Eſther</hi> preſents us with a notable draught of ſuch connexions; What a wonderful over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling <hi>Providence</hi> was there in the marriage of the King with one of his honeſt Subjects? in the treachery of <hi>Bignatha</hi> and <hi>Tereſh,</hi> intended againſt the King? <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s diſcovery of the Plot? the King's not ſleeping, &amp;c.? God kept Court at the Court; his <hi>Providence</hi> was waking whilſt the King cannot ſleep: the Lord reads his Church a Lecture of <hi>Providence,</hi> whilſt the King hath the Book of Records of the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> read before him; and knows how and when to make uſe of the <hi>Hamans</hi> at Princes Courts, to promote godly <hi>Mordecai's,</hi> for the good and welfare of his Church or People.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> As for Inſtruments, the Lord is not confined to theſe. If Thieves do not break in on <hi>Nabal,</hi> and ſo become Inſtruments of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101303:89"/> wrath; the Lord ſmites him that he dies, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 38. And if unlikely Agents for this or that work, be brought forth on the ſtage; yet nothing hinders, as God is pleaſed to concurr, but the effect is proportionable to a likely and promiſing cauſe of ſuch an effect. This may be ſeen in Spirituals and Politicals. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 27. A little Maid is an Hand-maid indeed, whereby a <hi>Naaman</hi> may come to the knowledg of the true God, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 2, 3. It is written of Mr. <hi>Peacock,</hi> how that under his agonies of conſcience, when ſome Miniſters asked him, Whether they ſhould pray for him; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>By no means; do not ſo diſhonour God, as to pray for ſuch a reprobate as I am.</hi> But his young Pupil ſtanding by, ſaid (with tears in his eyes), <hi>Certainly a reprobate could never be ſo tender of God's diſhonour.</hi> Which he well weighing, was thereby comforted and reſtored, when neither he with his Learning, nor any other ſons of the Prophets, could prove ſons of conſolation to him. Again in Politicals: The Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory informs of the noble acts of <hi>Solomon,</hi> though young and tender, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 1. with 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 28. And of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who was but eight years old when he began to reign, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 1. Each of their green years were well made up by the <hi>Ancient of days,</hi> as the Lord is termed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. The Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> gave <note place="margin">Hiſtory of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> lib. 2. p. 260.</note> thanks to God when <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth was dead; ſaying, That it was a miracle that he had left a Son behind him of but Nine years
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101303:90"/> old, that he might not be able to tread in the Father's ſteps. Thus theſe good Fathers, for their <hi>gravity,</hi> if not ſome of them for their <hi>levity,</hi> according to the probable iſſue of their Doctrine in forbidding Marriage, did ſoon ſhoot their bolt; they might have held their pop a while, and ſo have learnt this leſſon tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phramites</hi> quarrel with <hi>Gideon</hi> for not calling them forth when he fought with the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites:</hi> their ſharp chiding (recorded <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 1, 2.) did not end in a bloody battel, as it did at another time, when the like contending had its cloſure in the death of Forty and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the ſwaggering <hi>Ephramites:</hi> See <hi>Judg.</hi> 12. 1, 6.</p>

Say not, O my caſe, and the Church's caſe, is ſad indeed; behold, the ground is not a leight mold, but thick, heavy, ſtubborn clay, and withal very dry; how ſhall it be broken up? Where are the Oxen ſtrong for the labour? Say not ſo, in way of unbelief, The great God can moiſten the earth, provide the Oxen, do all in a moment. Remember that great man, in whom unbelief was regent, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. He talks of Windows in Heaven, and yet the Shop windows on earth were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the next day, according to the Prophet's words, <hi>v.</hi> 16. the great man ſaw the Market, but it was no fair one to him, for he was trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to death, <hi>v.</hi> 20.

                     <p>4. Treaſure up more than ordinary diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of <hi>Providence,</hi> in which thou haſt had a ſhare. Hath thy Barrel of Meal waſted not, nor thy Cruſe of Oyl fail'd not? according to that, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 16. O forget not that hand of <hi>Providence,</hi> which by that time that thou hadſt taken out one handful, and ſpent it, did caſt in another handful! Hath God at any time check't a <hi>Laban,</hi> calm'd an <hi>Eſau,</hi> cruſh't an <hi>Herod</hi> intending miſchief?

                     <p>THIS ſpecial Method may be conſidered,</p>
                     <p>1. In regard of God's afflicting men for ſin. Men have their Method in ſinning, God hath his in puniſhing. The bluſhing ſinner at firſt, after hath a brow of braſs. The <hi>walking in the counſel of the ungodly,</hi> makes way for <hi>ſtanding in the way of ſinners,</hi> and ſo for <hi>ſitting in the ſeat of the ſcornful,</hi> Pſal. 1. 1. Sin is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive; freſh-men, or Novices in the Devil's School, quickly aſpire after the Doctor's Chair. And as the ſinner hath thus his walk of vanity; ſo the Lord doth ordinarily warn before he ſtrikes. There is a fiting of the Beacons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hoſt or Army of Judgments is land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. In regard of exalting, parties; and ſo there is an humbling and abaſing work upon their hearts, which is preambulatory, or goes before. As <hi>pride goeth before deſtruction, and a haughty ſpirit before a fall,</hi> Prov. 16. 18. ſo <hi>the fear of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdom,</hi> and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101303:92"/> 
                        <hi>before honour is humility,</hi> Prov. 15. 33. <hi>Humble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up,</hi> James 4. 10. The humbling-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations which did betide <hi>Joſeph, David,</hi> with others, did lead the dance to exalting-ones.</p>
                     <p>3. In regard of converſion from a ſtate of nature to a ſtate of grace; and ſo there is conviction-work, which, like the needle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the cloath. Men leap not out of the warm bed of their Luſts, into the lap of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Comforts. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſtung with fiery Serpents, ere there was a looking to the brazen Serpent, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 8. They who are not ſenſible of the bitings of ſin, will not regard a Saviour. The pricking at the heart awakens men to conſideration-work, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 37.</p>
                     <p>4. In regard of ſome more than ordinary ſervice, unto which God calleth perſons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Church or State. God is pleaſed to vouchſafe more than ordinary encouragement, when he calleth perſons to more than ordinary employment. God was at the coſt and charges of Miracle after Miracle, when he ſends <hi>Moſes</hi> to bring his people out of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 4. <hi>Joſhua</hi> is told by God, <hi>As I was with Moſes, ſo I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> Joſh. 1. 5. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had an hard Chapter to read unto a ſtubborn people; he was ſenſible of his own pollution; difficulties there were not meerly in fancy's brow; the Lord helpeth and encourageth him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 5, to the end. <hi>Paul</hi> had an hard task, but the Lord ſweetens all, See <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>5. In regard of ſome afflictions with which,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101303:93"/> by way of trial, God may exerciſe ſome; and ſo there's a previous or preparatory work of <hi>Providence.</hi> God is before-hand with ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial againſt ſome fainting-fit. He ſtrengthens the back before he lays on the burden. Chriſt is transfigured on the high Mountain before <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>initio.</hi> and this to corroborate them, when he ſhall ſhortly be crucified and transfixed with a Spear on Mount <hi>Calvary:</hi> they needed this diſplay of <hi>Providence,</hi> as bladders, to bear up, when they were like to be plunged even to a queſtioning whether Chriſt were the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> for ſo we read <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. <hi>but we truſted that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. mention is made how <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into Paradiſe; and in <hi>v.</hi> 7. there is a relation of one, no good one, who did catch at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Comforts. 'Twas well for <hi>Paul</hi> that he was feaſted in the Lord's Dining-room, before he was had down into Satan's Dungeon of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: Had not the Coat of Mail been firſt put him on him, the thorn in the fleſh would have pierced and ſorely grieved him. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this, the Chriſtian's Sun doth ſhine very gloriouſly before ſome notable Eclipſe at hand.</p>

                     <p>1. SEE from whence it is that ſome judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians do give a notable gueſs at the iſſues of matters. They live nigh (in point
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101303:93"/> of communion) to the great Landlord of the World, and ſo know ſome of his ordinary walks hither and thither: one while he uſeth to walk up the hill, another while down into the valley; this they know and take notice of. Beſides, the great God is pleaſed ſometimes to tell them whither he is a going, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 17 <hi>And the Lord ſaid, ſhall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?</hi> And <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his ſecret unto his ſervants the Prophets.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> That he had a foreſight of the Calamities to come on <hi>Germany.</hi> The Reverend <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the time of the late Tragedy in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Sermons of ſome pious Miniſters have been better underſtood by their Hearers ſome years after. They who ſeemed to talk in the Clouds, have been acknowledged to ſpeak from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as to what hath fallen out on Earth.</p>
                     <p>2. Beware of croſſing and thwarting with ſuch ſpecial Methods of <hi>Providence;</hi> and that theſe ways:</p>
                     <p>1. In not heeding warnings, which is the too common ſin of men, who are as the deaf Adder, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſcribeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 4.</p>
                     <p>2. In not being abaſed under humbling-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations. Some are humbled, but not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a proud heart notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Plagues. Too much of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like heart is to be found where the Rod of God hath lighted. <hi>For the iniquity of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth; and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart,</hi> Iſa. 57. 17.</p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:101303:94"/>
                     <p>3. In not improving Convictions. Some break Priſon from them; they, with <hi>Cain,</hi> build Cities; or, with <hi>Saul,</hi> are for Muſick; few, with <hi>Paul,</hi> are wreſtling at a Throne of Grace under them, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. <hi>Behold he prayeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. In a backwardneſs to ſet upon ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular work as God calleth unto. <hi>Moſes</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to a miracle; yet he draws back, pleads his inſufficiency; yea, when that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by God, he hath nothing elſe to ſay, and that indeed was too unmannerly to be ſaid, <hi>Send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend,</hi> Exod. 4. 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>5. In not heeding and improving ſome fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Providence</hi> in order to a grapple with ſome future difficulty. It is ſaid of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>They cried out, and were ſore amazed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beyond meaſure, and wondred,</hi> Mar. 6. 49, 51. What was the ground of their diſquiet, Fear? Was there no Antidote to have checkt their trouble? Yea, there was; for Chriſt had done that before at land, which might have quieted them at ſea; the Miracle of the Loaves might have fed their faith, which would not then have been ſo ſea-ſick; this ſeems to be intimated in <hi>v.</hi> 52. <hi>For they conſidered not of the loaves, for their heart was hardned</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee then, that there is fault in croſſing with the Methods of <hi>Providence;</hi> and it hath been ſhewed particularly, how perſons do thus croſs. What remains, but to be on our watch? and that the rather, conſidering theſe two things:</p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:101303:94"/>
                     <p>1. Satan hath his Methods, which are wily ones; for ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerteth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11. Satan's deſign is to pervert and ſubvert. He will be buſie to make a man unprofitable under the Methods of the Lord He labours to make men ſlight warnings, ſtorm under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, ſtifle convictions, to be backward to any good work God calleth them unto; and to be forgetful of ſpecial <hi>Providences,</hi> which may have their future reference for ſupport under Difficulties.</p>
                     <p>2. It's man's wiſdom to comply with the Methods of the Lord. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is called <hi>an unwiſe ſon;</hi> and why? <hi>for he ſhould not ſtay long in the place of breaking forth of children,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 13. To be ſtupid and blockiſh under the Lord's Diſpenſations; not to eye God in them, and to have a recourſe to Him, and to improve them for good, is to be the <hi>unwiſe ſon</hi> with <hi>Ephraim.</hi>

                     <p>VVHAT foundation this hath in the Word, may appear divers ways:</p>
                     <p>1. There are types of this, before Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the human nature. <hi>This is he that was in the Church in the wilderneſs with the angel, which ſpake to him in the Mount Sinai, and with out fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who received the lively oracles to give unto us; to whom our fathers would not obey, but thruſt him from them:</hi> ſo <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 38, 39. To this, add that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 12. And as there are ſacred Draughts or Pictures of this, ſo Predictions of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. with <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 37. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, him ſhall ye hear,</hi> Pſal. 110. 1. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 44. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot-ſtool. Daniel</hi> had a predictory Viſion: <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the night viſions; and behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him, and</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:101303:95"/> 
                        <hi>there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, ſhould ſerve him: his dominion is an everlaſting do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which ſhall not paſs away; and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed,</hi> Dan. 7. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>2. There ſeems to be a notable praeludium or preface to this, in Chriſt's ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them queſtions; and in his reply to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my father's buſineſs,</hi> Luke 2. 46, 49. And before this, in the Wiſe-men's coming from the Eaſt, enquiring after him who was born King of the Jews, and doing their homage to him, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 11.</p>
                     <p>3. The ſolemn voice from Heaven, when Chriſt inaugurated or entred on his publick Miniſterial work, doth witneſs to this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>And lo a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> And ſo in Luke 9 35. <hi>There came a voice out of the cloud, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. There are plain and poſitive Aſſertions on this wiſe; Mat. 28. 18. <hi>All power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 22. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church,</hi> Mat. 13. 41. <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his angels,</hi> John 5. 27. <hi>And hath given him authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.</hi> This is (ſaith <hi>Muſculus</hi>) as if ſo be we ſhould ſpeak of the Sun; the Sun burns not any one,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101303:96"/> but hath given all burning to his beams. This kind of ſpeech doth not exclude the Sun from a virtue or efficacy to burn or illuminate; but aſcribes the work of burning and enlightning to his beams, in and by which the Sun doth burn and enlighten; for what heat and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor the beams have, they have it from the Sun, After this ſort the Father is ſaid <hi>to judg no out, but to have committed all judgment to the Son,</hi> when he judgeth all things in the Son.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. SEE what ground there is for honouring Chriſt. This inference Chriſt himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducteth, That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. <hi>He that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him,</hi> John 5. 23. with 22. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt then in his Natures, in his Offices, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet; in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in his Goſpel-day for worſhip, in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People. Honour Him both in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice, with due reſpect had to Him according to the fore-mentioned ways.</p>
                     <p>2. What a bold Adventure is it for the ſons of men, to affront Chriſt, or rage againſt Him! This is an Evil cautioned againſt; and the attempts of men, as they will be fruitleſs, ſo no leſs dangerous to themſelves, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not. What do ſinners but take a great deal of pains to get a Stone of vaſt bigneſs up the

The interrogation hath its dehortative conſiderations; No reaſon ſo to do. And as it is horrid ſin, ſo no leſs folly in regard of the iſſue: The Lord laughs at ſuch fooliſh Children's play, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Chriſt is on the holy hill of <hi>Zion, v.</hi> 6. there is no beating him off that hill; <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron: and daſh them in pieces like a potter's veſſel,</hi> v. 9.</p>
                     <p>3. Here is ground for ſupport and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the Wilderneſs of this World. Chriſt relgneth, is good news to <hi>Zion</hi>'s friends. There are four props for ſinking-ſpirits under black clouds: (1.) Jeſus Chriſt hath his glorious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which are not empty ones. His Name ſhall be called, <hi>Wonderful, Counſellor, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6. He is <hi>the Prince of the kings of the earth,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. (2.) The Holy Spirit, as an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Agent, ſweetly concenters in, or joins iſſue with Chriſt in the ordering and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of matters: ſee <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. and 16. 7, 8.

And that evil Angels have their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yet not abſolute arbitrary ones, may be collected from 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. where the Prince of darkneſs is a lying ſpirit in the mouth of the falſe prophets, and ſo the warr there goes on. The Agency of Angels is extenſive to perſons ſingly conſidered. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſees Angels aſcending and deſcending his Ladder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12. Theſe winged Courſers attend the meaneſt Saint. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them,</hi> Pſal. 34. 7. and well for Saints it is ſo: for the evil Angels are for playing ſmall games, as well as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ones. We read of two men poſſeſſed of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8 28. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> cries out, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid: my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a devil,</hi> Mat. 15. 22.</p>
                     <p>4. From the particular work ſpecified, about which Angels are verſant. Intimations there are in Scripture, both as to good and bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: they have each their ſhops, where they may be found hard at work in this world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The good Angels may be conſider'd with reſpect to good and bad ones in the world. Their work is to do the Lord's work, and that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101303:98"/> as it reſpecteth the Lord's people, divers ways.</p>
                     <p>1. Good Angels promote Goſpel-work in order to perſons being brought to the means of grace, or the means of grace to them. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was willed by an Angel to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10. 3, 5. A Viſion appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> in the night; <hi>There ſtood a man of Macedonis, and prayed him, ſaying, Come over into Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and help us,</hi> Acts 16. 9. The Angels know the ſtate of the Countrey, and have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> influence on the Goſpel-Seeds-men, for the caſting of the Seed in this or that plat of ground. Yea,</p>
                     <p>2. The good Angels become truly Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctors, in diſcovering or intimating the will of God about matters, and comforting the troubled ſpirits of his ſervants. Inſtances there are to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 3, 15 <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>3. Good Angels are Saints Guardians, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders under God. <hi>Lot</hi> had experience of this. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 11, 16. <hi>My God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi>) <hi>hath ſent his Angel, and hath ſhut the Lions mouths, that they have not hurt me, Dan.</hi> 6 22. Their preſervation, as the Lord pleaſeth, is a part of the Angels commiſſion: as it is aſſerted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11, 12. This Satan knew, and therefore ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, though in a majmed ſenſe, and to a bid end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                     <p>4. Good Angels are encouragers and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on of God's Saints in that work unto which God calleth them. So in <hi>Eliſha</hi> his caſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 5, 6, 7. So <hi>Paul,</hi> encouraged to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101303:98"/> 
                        <hi>Ceſar,</hi> Acts 27. 24. <hi>Abraham</hi> tells his fervant, ſaying, <hi>He ſhall ſend his angel before thee,</hi> Gen. 24. 7.</p>
                     <p>5. Good Angels may ſometimes be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in afflicting God's profeſſed people; they, as Heaven's Chirurgeons, are taken up in launcing, and cutting-work. When thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands fell by the Peſtilence, an Angel of the Lord is ſeen with a drawn ſword, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 14, 15. An Angel threatens <hi>Zacharia,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Tbou ſhalt be dumb,</hi> Luke 1. 20. It's probable the Angel might ſmite him with dumbneſs, as the Angels ſmote the <hi>Sodomites</hi> with blindneſs.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Whatever other work the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do, they are not wanting at death, and after death. <hi>Lazarus</hi> dies, and is carried by the Angels into heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. And whether their care be not verſant about the carkaſs, yea, the duſt of a believer, is not to be denied. A contention we read of about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Jude <hi>v.</hi> 9. At the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Angels gather together the Elect from the four winds, from one end of Heaven to another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, The Miniſtry of good Angels reſpects bad or wicked ones in the world; and that,</p>
                     <p>1. By way of inhibition, check, or reproof. The Angel of the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Balaam, Wherefore haſt thou ſmitten thine aſſe theſe three times?</hi> Numb 22. 32.</p>
                     <p>2. By way of compaſſion, or doing ſome office of kindneſs. There is a voice of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed nature, as well as the voice of grace,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101303:99"/> which comes up before the Lord. <hi>Iſmael</hi> hath a ſhare in Angelical kindneſs, when like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>3. By way of ſmart and puniſhment for defaults. They are executioners of divine wrath. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> were ſmitten with blindneſs; <hi>Syrians</hi> deſtroyed by an Angel of the Lord: And though human creatures ſhall be inſtruments to burn the Whore of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> yet that may include the Miniſtry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; they may prepare the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ewel, and blow the bellows: for ſeven Angels are ſaid to pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond branch of the diſcourſe of the Miniſtry of Angels, reſpects the evil ones. Theſe have their ſhops in the world, and their ſhops are dark ones. The evil Angels are Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the darkneſs of this world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. Now how the evil Angels have their influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both as to godly and ungodly men in the world, I ſhall in brief touch, and ſo paſs to the accommodation or improvement of the whole that hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Devil hath his deſign againſt pious ones, and that divers ways:</p>
                     <p>1. In tempting them to ſin. He hath his wiles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11. He labours not only to catch young birds, but old ones too with his chaff net, and lime-twigs. <hi>David</hi> was an experience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:101303:99"/> have there recorded in the after-verſes.</p>
                     <p>2. In diſquieting them one way or other, though he hath not matter of juſt charge to draw up up againſt them. The Devil is the trouble-houſe of the Chriſtian's quiet. He is the accuſer of the brethren, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. both he, and thoſe who are acted by him, are falſe witneſſes riſen up, and lay things to a Saint's charge that he knew not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 11. Go we to that good Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and he will tell us, he cannot be quiet for a buffeting devil, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
                     <p>3. In impeding and hindring them in ſome particular good work intended by them. The Devil throws blocks in their way. He hath his turn-pikes and barricado's to obſtruct the Chriſtian in his courſe. <hi>Wherefore we would have come unto you</hi> (even I <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>once and again, but Satan hindred us,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 18.</p>
                     <p>4. In afflicting of them in their outward man, body, relations, eſtate: when God ſees fit to chaſtiſe, and exerciſe his people on this wiſe. A clear and full exemplification for this, we have in the firſt and ſecond chapters of <hi>Job.</hi> God is wiſe in ſuch diſpenſations. He knows how to make a bright Saint, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's dusky Cinders; and to fetch out a ſpot of a Saint's Garment, by Hell's Black-Soap.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Satan hath his deſign on wicked men, or ſuch who are deſtitute of a principle of Grace within; and that,</p>
                     <p>1. In ſtaving them off from what is good. He works with might and main, that they may not come to the knowledg of God, as God
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101303:100"/> ought to be known. <hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

The Devil holds up his monſtrous and uglifying-glaſſes before the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's face; he fills their heads with prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the good ways of God, his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, People, who ſhall be look't on as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of a Nation, City, Pariſh, Family, that are only the wakeners thereof, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>2. In poſting them on in what is evil. He will have them be poſitive as well as negative ſinners; not only not to act for God but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; though in not acting for God, there is an acting againſt him, but not ſuch an aggravated acting. The Maſters of the <hi>Pythoneſs</hi>-Damſel become Perſecutors of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Act.</hi> 16. 16, 19, &amp;c. <hi>Judas</hi> becomes the betrayer of his Lord and Maſter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 27. Satan entred into him; and many Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of this world become Satans Hang-men. He hath his influences on them; for he doth not in mens ſhape caſt Gods Servants into priſon, and yet is ſaid to do it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                     <p>3. In being ready and forward enough to haſten the deſtruction of them, theirs, what they have. The Devil is for making men more twofold Children of Hell, and cares not how ſoon he can ſecure moſt of his Agents in the priſon of Hell. Satan hath his end, if he can double mens guilts, under the ſmarts
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101303:100"/> of which he is an inſtrument in inflicting. He delighteth in miſchief, and needs not a motive to perſwade an <hi>Ahab</hi> to go up and fail at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead:</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 20, 21, 22.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. LOOK after an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. For, (1.) Hereby the evil Angels need not be dreaded. Chriſt, the victorious one, breaks the bow and ſpear of Hell. Satan had experience of the Power and Valour of the Chriſtian's Generaliſſimo, in that Wilderneſs-Conflict, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. The Devil with all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhall not tread down the weakeſt Soldier in Chriſt's Army, to the nethermoſt Hell. <hi>I give unto them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand,</hi> Joh. 10. 28. (2.) As the evil Angels need not be dreaded as enemies; ſo the good Angels, the gliſtering Courtiers of Heaven, may be look't on as friends. It is ſaid of <hi>Jacob, He went on his way, and the Angels of God met him,</hi> Gen. 32. 1. The good Angels will be found good and faithful friends to thoſe who are good: they were <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Guard; and the way to have a <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Guard, is to have a <hi>Jacob</hi>'s God.</p>
                     <p>2. Believe more, and live more, the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Doctrine of the agency of Angels. It may put moſt to the bluſh, that they live as if ſo
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101303:101"/> be there were neither good nor bad Angels. The practiſe of moſt, holds little correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with their belief. It concerns then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to mind their duty, and that in reſpect both of good and bad Angels.</p>
                     <p>1. In reſpect of good Angels: and ſo (1.) bleſs God for the Miniſtry of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. If ſheep, oxen, with other creatures or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the uſe of man, do oblige man by way of thankfulneſs to God; why not the good Angels, who are miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation? <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. It well becomes men to praiſe God for angels, though we are not to pray to angels; for, as good as they are, they like not ſuch a ſervice, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. 'Twas the evil angel who would be a worſhipful Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid here, <hi>There is not ſuch an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good angels, as of old; and therefore, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> there an agency of good angels?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. There is no reaſon to be ſtumbled at the different diſpenſation of things then and now. Jeſus Chriſt, the Prince of angels, is come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. We have the Scriptures, the Canon of them, enlarged, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. If a Maſter ſet down his will for the management of ſuch or ſuch a Farm, what if he do not ever and anon ſend meſſengers for ſignifying this or that about the Farm. The Church is not now in its non-age, and ſo ſtands not ſo in need of viſible helps, as a pillar of cloud
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101303:101"/> and of fire, as of old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18. The Lord will teach now to exerciſe faith more: It is not for a Chriſtian <hi>to believe no further than he can ſee.</hi> This was the fault of <hi>Thomas,</hi> for which he was check't, <hi>John</hi> 20. 25, 27, 29.</p>
                     <p>2. To argue from the not viſible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good angels, to a non-agency of good angels, is abſurd: for by the ſame reaſon the evil angels are no agents unleſs they have a viſible ſhape. I do not think that <hi>Job</hi> ſaw the Devil, and yet he felt him to his ſorrow in his ſufferings. Good angels are at their work, though neither good nor bad men ſee them. <hi>Daniel</hi> had no ground to believe that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel neglected the Church's affairs, becauſe he ſaw him not for the one and twenty days ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>3. It is not denied, as if there were not ſome angelical diſplay more than ordinary. It is true, the good angels bring no new doctrine; for that were to incurr the Apoſtolical Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. Howbeit this inferreth not, but the Lord may at times, after a more than ordinary way, by them help the underſtanding in the right perception of ſome Scripture, direct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the prevention of dangers at hand, and relieve others under ſinking-diſtreſſes. <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> had a paſſage of Scripture in a Viſion ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him, which did clear up the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that phraſe, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and that at a very ſeaſonable nick of time. <hi>Scultetus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth a ſtory of <hi>Gryneus,</hi> which happened at <hi>Spires:</hi> There comes one of ſuch a port, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101303:102"/> and beauty, which did beſpeak ſingular dignity; he comes to <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s Lodging, asketh for <hi>Gryneus,</hi> who was then abſent; and withal ſignifies, how there were ſnares pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for <hi>Gryneus,</hi> into which he would not have that good and learned man fall; and ſo departs. <hi>Gryneus</hi> by and by returns, whom <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> bids forthwith be gone from <hi>Spires</hi> to <hi>Heidelberge;</hi> and not long after <hi>Gryneus</hi> his departure, an armed company comes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Gryneus. Luther</hi> tells, how at <hi>Eiliben</hi> a woman with two children ſuffered extream want and need in time of dearth: they go towards a Well, and meet with a man (an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel) who ask't, Whether ſhe thought to get ſomething to eat at the Fountain? She ſaid, Why not? for all things are poſſible to God, and eaſie to be done; he that ſed the great multitude of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> forty years with <hi>Manna,</hi> he can preſerve me and mine with drinking water. The Angel ſaith, Go home, and thou ſhalt find three buſhels of Meal. And ſo it was. And thus in anſwer to the Objection from the non-appearance of good angels, as of old, to the non-agency of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                     <p>2. There is no reaſon to be deſpondent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſucceeding of perſonal and publick matters. There are inviſible friends, who want neither will nor skill to promote what may make for the beſt. What though there are letts in the way? they know how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move blocks, or place the wedg ſo, as that the blocks ſhall be ſhattered to pieces. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101303:102"/> ſervant objects, <hi>Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land,</hi> Gen. 24. 5. he hath an anſwer in <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>He ſhall ſend his angel before thee.</hi> Thoſe pious Matrons, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 1. ſaid among themſelves, <hi>Who ſhall roll us away the ſtone from the door of the ſepulcher,</hi> v. 3. that work they ſound done, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and how and by whom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2. doth fully mention.</p>
                     <p>3. Exerciſe more of faith and hope in God under dangers. Here is no reaſon why the Chriſtian ſhould be hopeleſs and heartleſs in the lack of viſible means. The ſervant of the Man of God, when the Hoſt compaſſed the City both with Horſes and Chariots, ſaid unto <hi>Eliſha, Alas my Maſter! what ſhall we do!</hi> But what ſaith the Maſter? He anſwered, <hi>Fear not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them:</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> prayed, and ſaid, <hi>Lord, I pray thee open his eyes, that he may ſee. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he ſaw; and behold the mountain was full of horſes and chariots of fire round about Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 6. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>4. Demean we our ſelves after a reverend manner in ſolemn approaches to God in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſin: neither ſay thou before the angel, that it was an error,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 6. If Chriſt, the Angel of the Covenant, be there meant; yet the angels are Super-viſors, Spectators, Witneſſes, of perſons deportment. And hence the Apoſtle dehorteth women from immodeſt and uncomely beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (according as the throwing aſide of the vail may there import) <hi>becauſe of the angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 10.</p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:101303:103"/>
                     <p>5. Imitate the good angels in point of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. They diſdain not the meaneſt Saint, nor the meaneſt ſervice about the meaneſt Saint.

The angels watch the Cradles, though they rock them not; and preſerve little ones from and in many dangers, ere they come to riper years: this office the angels indefinitely diſcharge towards them, whoſe Life-guard they are; and that without a proud grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or grudging pride to be ſo meanly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>

                     <p>1. Admire the Lords free-grace, in being brought out of a ſtate of ſpiritual bondage to them.

                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Be thankful, in that evil angels are reſtrained from doing miſchief. That God ties up the dogs of hell is no ſmall mercy: they being let looſe might be biting ones.</p>

                     <p>THAT the Angels both good and bad are at the check of the Almighty, hath been collaterally at leaſt evidenced in the fore-going Obſervation. What hath been ſaid of their miniſtry is to be underſtood in way of ſubſerviency to the Lord: The evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, though they act evilly, yet act not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely without the permiſſion of the Holy One. The Lord hath them in the chain of Providence, and though they are at times priſoners at large, yet priſoners ſtill, ſee 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 22. <hi>Job</hi> 1. 12. &amp; 2. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31, 32. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. And as for the good Angels, they are the winged cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of heaven, ready to do the will of their Lord. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 6, 11, 14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 19. They have a connatural principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, confirmed by grace, which renders them obſequious to Gods command; and hence we are to propound them as patterns for ready compliance with the will of God, as
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101303:104"/> that paſſage, <hi>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven,</hi> doth imply, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 10. There is no need then in further dilating on this. Now, that other Creatures are at the powerful beck and controll of God, is to be ſpoken to: And this appears divers ways.</p>
                     <p>1. From the appellation attributed to God in Scripture: He is ſtiled <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and that ſome hundreds of times, as ſome obſerve. The often repetition of this Title, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the tranſcendent verity, and the uſefulneſs of this Meditation, namely, That all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are under His command, to be lorded over by Him when and how he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>2. From the conſideration of the Creatures as Creatures. What are the Creatures in their Beeings and Operations, but reſults, ebbings and flowings of his Divine Will: <hi>for he ſpake, and it was done; he commanded, and it ſtood faſt,</hi> Pſal. 33. 9. The words of men are wind in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what the Lord ſaith. 'Twas but a word and a world, of old. The ſame powerful ſpeech of the Almighty is heard ſtill in the world.</p>
                     <p>3. From an exemplary induction: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Creatures as thus diſtinguiſht.</p>
                     <p>1. Some are without ſenſe; and yet theſe have the ſenſe to obey the Lord: <hi>for he ſaith to the ſnow, Be thou on the earth; likewiſe to the ſmall rain, and to the great rain of his ſtrength,</hi> Job 37. 6. <hi>Mine hand alſo hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath ſpanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they ſtand up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> Iſa. 48. 13.

                     <p>2: Other creatures of corporeal exiſtence, which have ſenſe, are at the beck of God: and theſe may be diſtinguiſht (1) into ſuch which have ſenſe only, without the addition of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional principle, being ſwayed by natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. (2.) Into ſuch, which together with ſenſe, have reaſon or underſtanding as man hath. Now not only the creatures of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rank or order, whether they be flying-fowls after their kind, or fiſhes moving in the waters after their kind; or beaſts, cattel, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, after their re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1. LEARN from hence, what a God the Lord is. He is ſuch an One, whoſe Dominion is extenſive all the World over. The greateſt in the World are at his check or controll. <hi>With him is ſtrength and wiſdom, the deceived and deceiver are his: he leadeth Counſellors away ſpoiled, and maketh the Judges fools. He looſeth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. He leadeth princes away ſpoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. He remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth away the ſpeech of the truſty, and taketh away the underſtanding of the aged. He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakneth the ſtrength of the mighty,</hi> Job 12. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. See the vanity of Idolaters. <hi>Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles, that can cauſe rain? Or can the heavens give ſhowers? Art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou haſt made all theſe things,</hi> Jer. 14. 22. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. ver. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>3. Obſerve an Argument for the proof of Chriſt's Deity. He lords it over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; they give homage to Him. The winds and ſea obey him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 26, 27. The fig-tree withereth at the blaſt of his lips, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 19, 20.

The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> notes this, ſaying, <hi>When they were but few men in number, yea, very few, and ſtrangers in it</hi> (the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>); <hi>when they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another, he ſuffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their ſakes, ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm,</hi> Pſal. 105. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Deſpond not in ſpirit as touching the converſion of the vileſt and moſt wretched ones, whether they are Relations or others. God can, and in his due time will, make them throw down their weapons, if they do belong to the election of grace. Barren ſinners may become fruitful Saints. The Lord can turn Lions into Lambs. <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Apoſtle of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 27, 28. Brutiſh <hi>Corinthians</hi> are <hi>waſhed, ſanctified, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11.</p>
                     <p>6. Be the more encouraged to mind ſuch work as God calleth unto, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding wants and exigencies which preſent themſelves. The Lord hath ways enough to help and provide meat for labourers in his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.

                     <p>7. What ground is there for ſinners to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of their ways, and to turn unto the Lord with all their heart?

They are the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ones, who have the benign aſpect of the great God; and therefore godly ones have ground to bear up cheerfully, having an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in a Kingly Friend, or Friendly King. <hi>Let Iſrael rejoice in him that made him.

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>BEFORE hath been ſhewed how the Creatures are at the beck of God; Here is a further illuſtration of that in the general, but a more particular diſcovery how one and the ſame Creature is, after a different ſort, at the beck of <hi>Providence.</hi> The truth of this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears,</p>
                     <p>1. From aſſertions in Scripture. So <hi>Job</hi> 37. <hi>Alſo by watering he wearieth the thick cloud, be ſcattereth his bright cloud, and it is turned about by his counſels, that they may do whatſoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them upon the face of the world, in the earth.</hi> He cauſeth it to come, whether for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or a rod, or for his land, or for mercy, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. And as this holds in things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo alſo immoral agents: ſo Prov. 16. 7. <hi>When a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> An Enemy (as the Lord when and where he pleaſeth to exert his will) becomes a Friend, and a Friend an Enemy.</p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:101303:107"/>
                     <p>2. From Exemplifications. So the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which were <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Fortreſs, are a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or Grave for the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Pſal. 135. 13, 14, 15. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> deal with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at their going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> rather as with ſons and daughters, than as ſlaves; they give them their portions. <hi>The Lord gave the people favour in the ſight of the Egyptians, ſo that they lent unto them ſuch things as they required,</hi> Exod. 12. 32. It is ſaid of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, They ſhall drive thee from men,</hi> Dan. 4. 32. Who were thoſe Drivers, but thoſe that were his Reſtorers? for ſo it is ſaid, v. 36. <hi>My Counſellors and my Lords ſought unto me, and I was eſtabliſhed in my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and excellent majeſty was added to me. Paul,</hi> from a Perſecutor of the Chriſtians, becomes a ſolid Preacher to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>3. From particular Demonſtrations; and that from the Creatures proving, (1.) Friends. (2.) Foes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whoſo ſhall conſider God as Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, need not queſtion the Creatures becoming Friends: for,</p>
                     <p>1. Though the Creatures have their noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities, yet God can and doth inhibit them from hurting, when he ſees good ſo to do. A Lion ſlew the Prophet, and not the Aſs which ſtood by the Carkaſs, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 24. The Lions devour not <hi>Daniel,</hi> but they have the maſtery of his accuſers, and break all their bones in pieces ere ever they came to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 24. A Viper faſt'ned on <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand, and he ſhook off the beaſt into the fire, and felt no harm, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 3, 5. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101303:108"/> Lions and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Viper become negative friends, for they hurt them not. And poſitive friends, occaſionally; inaſmuch as theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being ſerved with a Divine Writ of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition. Both King <hi>Darius</hi> and the barbarous people are induced to ſhew kindneſs to theſe ſervants of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 23, to the end; and <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>2. As God doth inhibit Creatures from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurtful, ſo he doth to a wonder render them helpful and uſeful. They were the barbarous people that ſhewed no little kindneſs to <hi>Paul,</hi> and that before the <hi>Viper-Providence</hi> happened, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 2. <hi>Elijah</hi> had a notable experiment of this: <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>commanded the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to feed thee,</hi> 1 King. 17. 3. The Ravens brought him bread and fleſh in the morning, and bread and fleſh in the evening, <hi>v.</hi> 6. one would have thought the Ravens were not fit Truſtees for bread and fleſh; they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have eaten it, than brought it to be eaten; but what ſhall they not do, if the great [<hi>I</hi>] of Heaven and Earth hath ſo appointed. I could tell here a ſtory from a very good hand, How a good man was in very great diſtreſs for want of food; and at the very nick of ſuch a pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing want; a ſtrange Dog, unknown to belong to any of his neighbours, comes in to his houſe with a ſhoulder of Mutton, which he fairly lays down, and gets him away, having diſcharged the office of a good Market man for thoſe who could eat that Commons, hunger being their beſt ſawce.</p>
                     <p>3. Suppoſe the Lord do not work according
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101303:108"/> to the forementioned ways; yet He, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Infinite Power, Wiſdom, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, can and doth in his Providence render the Creatures as Friends another way. We may diſtinguiſh Friends into intentional ones, and eventual ones. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren acted as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and whilſt they thus act, they are even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as the Lord over-ruleth, his friends, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 5. I make no queſtion but divers can ſay, How their greateſt enemies have in ſome reſpect been their greateſt friends; whilſt others have play'd the <hi>Turks</hi> with them, they have become the better <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Creatures become enemies, as the Lord ſhall make uſe of them for wiſe and righteous ends or purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>1. Some Creatures have their natural defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and offenſive arms, which they quickly make uſe of when the ſign of battel is given by the Lord of Hoſts. <hi>David</hi> tells of the paw of the Lion, and the paw of the Bear, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. We read of two ſhe-bears which came forth out of the Wood, and tare Forty and two Children which mocked the Prophet of the Lord, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 23, 24. Thoſe new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies placed by the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Samaria,</hi> feared not the Lord; therefore the Lord ſent Lions amongſt them, which ſlew ſome of them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> in their ſong of Victory, deſcant on this wiſe: <hi>They fought from heaven: the ſtarrs in their courſes fought againſt Siſera: the river of Kiſhon ſwept them away, that ancient river, the river of Kiſhon. O my ſoul, thou haſt trodden down ſtrength,</hi> Judg. 5. 20, 21.</p>

                     <p>2. Other Creatures, wherein they are defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in regard of annoyance, by virtue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to other Creatures; may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in regard of co-incident circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, prove very afflictive. <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſſe was none of the wildeſt; for the Aſſe ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Balaam, Am not I thine aſſe upon which thou haſt ridden ever ſince I was thine, unto this day? Was I ever wont to do ſo unto thee? And he ſaid, Nay,</hi> Numb. 22. 30. We have here the appeal of the Aſſe, and the acknowledgment of the Maſter, both accord in the truth of the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and yet we find an harſh concluſion, for ſhe cruſht <hi>Balaam</hi>'s foot againſt the wall, <hi>v.</hi> 25. So calm a Creature as <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſſe, at ſuch a place where a wall being on this ſide, and a wall on that ſide, together with the Angel of the Lord ſtanding in the path of the Vineyards, <hi>v.</hi> 24. becomes a ſcourge to the Rider.</p>

                     <p>1. FROM the Creatures being made friends to us, (1.) Forget not whence it is that the Creatures ſmile on thee, and do not frown. It's from the pleaſure of their Lord or Maſter, that theſe ſervants in the general, and thoſe of them which are of rough temper in particular, do beſpeak you fairly, and run to and fro willingly to do you ſervice. <hi>I will</hi> (ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>both lay me down in peace, and ſleep, for thou Lord only makeſt me to dwell in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Pſal. 4. 8. <hi>The Lord is my ſhepherd, I ſhall not want,</hi> Pſal. 23. 1. <hi>The Lord hears the heavens, ere the corn, wine, and oyl, hear Jezreel,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 21, 22. (2.) Labour to demean thy ſelf in all godlineſs and honeſty, ſuitably to thy mercies. There is good reaſon for ſuch to ſerve God, who have the Creatures as ſo many good ſervants to wait upon them. There is an obligation on man to obey his God; and the more his mercies are, the ſtronger is the obligation. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah 6. 8.</p>
                     <p>2. From the Creatures being Corroſives or Scourges one way or other:</p>
                     <p>1. Obſerve, How the ſweeteſt Wine may become the ſharpeſt Vinegar; and this,

                     <p>1. With reſpect to Things. The good things of this life may be matter of affliction. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs, and with gladneſs of heart, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things; therefore ſhalt thou ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. With reſpect to Perſons, as Magiſtrates, Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, Family-relations, choice Friends or Acquaintants: All theſe, inſtead of Roſes, may become pricking-briers ſome way or other, as may be inſtanced in.</p>
                     <p>1. Magiſtrates, who are the Miniſters of God for good according to their inſtitution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. theſe may be ſnatch't away by death to the grief of a People who ſate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their refreſhing-ſhadow. Their deaths and burials become the reſurrection of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſorrows. Witneſs this in the caſe of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who dies and is buried, and all <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> mourned for him, and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> lamented for him, as is recorded, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 24, 25. Or if they be not ſeized on by death, they may prove the death or bane of a Nation by their follies. Inſtances enough there are for this in Holy-Writ, and Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>2. Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters become afflictive;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101303:110"/> and that many ways. When ſins abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a people, pride, barrenneſs under the means, ſlighting Miniſters, and idolizing of them (for theſe are ſad extreams), do, with others ſins, provoke the Lord to afflict in and by Miniſters. Sometimes they are taken away by death. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples had too high thoughts of their Maſter: they began (it ſeems) to make a party againſt Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 3. 25, 26. it's obſervable, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>John</hi> was not yet caſt into priſon. Afterward he was, and beheaded too. Sometimes, though God continue them in the world, yet he may make their tongues cleave to the root of their mouths. <hi>They ſhall be dumb, and not be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> as Ezek. 3. 26. The pipes ſhall be ſtopt, and the Conduits in the Towns ſhall not run as formerly with that plenty of the Water of Life. There is a time when the Prophets of the Lord are in their caves, and not upon the houſe-top, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4. Again, ſome may become afflictive by their ſlips, falls, apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. <hi>Tertullian</hi> turn'd a <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> and flies out againſt the Orthodox. <note place="margin">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101303:111"/> but a very irregular or erroneous head. God is righteous, as in the digging of a grave for ſome in the Vineyard, and the binding of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand and foot; ſo in the permiſſion of others to leap over the hedg of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and to be be-wilder'd in wild and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant fancies and conceits. See <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>3. Family-relations become Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. (1.) The Husband is ſometimes a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and folly is with him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 25. or if he be otherwiſe, his death gives life to the Wife's ſorrows, as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Thy ſervant my husband</hi> (ſaid that Widow to <hi>Eliſha</hi>) <hi>is dead, and thou knoweſt that thy ſervant did for the Lord; and the Creditor is come to take to his my two ſons for bond-men.</hi> (2.)

                     <p>4. Choice Friends bring up the rear of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.

                     <p>1. THE meaneſt or leaſt of the Creatures ſet off more the beauty of the Univerſe. A Giant is the more conſpicuous, when a Dwarf is brought forth on the ſtage with him. <hi>Behemoth,</hi> or the Elephant, is ſaid to be the chief of the ways of God, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 19. the vaſt extenſions of the Elephant are the more illuſtrious, when compared with the ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of a Worm or Flye.</p>
                     <p>2. The very ſmalneſs or littleneſs of the <note place="margin">Sicut e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices illi peritiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genioſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimi ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentur, qui in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſſimo ſpatio, pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum artis oſtendunt (ut qui ſub muſcae umbra currum &amp; equos repraeſentavit): ſic Deus ſi non tantam in minutis animaleulis potentiam, quantam in majoribus oſtendir; at ſapientiae certe majus ſpecimen edidit. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> p. 1466.</note> Creatures doth ſet forth the Wiſdom of God. The curious workmanſhip about a Watch or ſome leſſer piece of Artifice, doth commend the skill of the Artificer. Creeping things, and Birds flying, as well as Beaſts and Cattel, do bear a part in the Quire, to ſound forth the praiſes of their Maker and Preſerver, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 10. with <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:101303:113"/>
                     <p>3. The Creatures by reaſon of their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did not hold back the ſentence of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation at their creation, or when they were firſt uſhered into the world. The Hiſtory of the Creation comprehends little fiſhes, birds, and creeping things; God ſaw what was then created, that it was good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 25.</p>
                     <p>4. The meaneſt Creatures have their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary uſe for which they ſerve. They are not dumb Cyphers in the World's Arithmetick. The Herb is ſaid to be for the ſervice of man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 14. Even Serpents and Vermin are ſerviceable, in attracting to themſelves that Venom which otherwiſe might be of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequence to man. Worms and Flyes are baits for Fiſhes, and food for Birds.</p>
                     <p>5. What is wanting in the meaneſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures one way, is ſalved up another. <hi>There be four things which are but little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wiſe: The Ants are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not ſtrong, yet they prepare their meat in the ſummer: the Conies are but feeble folks, yet make they their houſes in the rocks: the Locuſts have no king; yet go they forth all of them by bands: the Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in the kings palaces,</hi> Prov. 30. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. There is a diſplay of the glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God in and about the meaneſt of Creatures; and that in a more than ordinary way, as He is pleaſed to make uſe of them. We may behold as in a glaſs, (1.) The Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Mercy of God. (2.) Wiſdom. (3.) Power. 4. Juſtice or Severity.</p>

                     <p>1. The Goodneſs or Mercy of God is ſeen, as when he uſeth them for the help of man. The Ravens in a time of famine bring <hi>Elijah</hi> bread and fleſh, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 6. The ſtories are known, how <hi>Moulin</hi> at the time of the <hi>Pariſian</hi>-Maſſacre, was cheriſhed for a fortnight by a Hen, which came conſtantly, and laid her Eggs there where he lay hid. And at <hi>Cales,</hi> how an Engliſh-man who crept into an hole under a pair of Stairs, was there preſerved by means of a Spider, which had woven its Web over the hole, and ſo the Soldiers ſlighted the ſearch there.

And thus for Mercy diſplayed in the meaneſt creatures.</p>
                     <p>2. The Wiſdom of God is diſplayed: for in and by the meaneſt creatures He exalts His Wiſdom to check the pride of the greateſt of men. <hi>Zebah</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> ſay to <hi>Gideon, Riſe thou, and fall upon us.</hi> They look't on it as a diſhonour to be ſlain by a Boy, <hi>Jether, Gideon</hi>'s Son, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 20, 21. The Lord takes down the ſwelling-humour of men, by means contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Eccl. lib. 2. c. 30</note> of the <hi>Perſians</hi> beſieged the City <hi>Nicibis,</hi> in the which the Chriſtians were fore diſtreſſed: On a ſudden a vaſt company of Waſps and Flies came, get into the ſnouts of the Elephants, and the ears of the Horſes and other Beaſts, ſo that Elephants and Horſes brake their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, caſt their Riders, and force the diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ranks to flie. The King hereupon behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand of God, is neceſſitated to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the ſiege.</p>
                     <p>3. The Power of God is wonderfully ſeen in matters of this nature. The Lord exalted his Power in the ſlaughter of <hi>Goliah</hi> by a ſtone caſt out of a Sling. <hi>Goliah</hi> is ſtoned for a Blaſphemer, whom the trembling <hi>Iſraelites</hi> reach't not with their Swords and Spears.

                     <p>4. The Juſtice and Severity of God may be viewed, as in the fore-going inſtances: for the Attributes of God do concenter, or notably meet, in one and the ſame Diſpenſation. God doth by one Diſpenſation ſtroak his people, and ſtrike the adverſaries of his people. The Saints Crutches are the Sinners Thunderbolt. The Lord writes bitter things by the hand of the meaneſt creatures, when he will make uſe of ſuch <hi>amanuenſes.</hi> The Palmer-worm, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt, Canker-worm, Caterpillar, ſhall lay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and waſt the Countrey, if he ſo dictate in his <hi>Providence,</hi> Joel 1. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 9. <note place="margin">Nam ii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſi ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, ipſos Dominos ſuos quaſi latrones, ſancti Corporis reos, dente vindice, tanquam ignotos &amp; inimicos laniaverunt.</note> yea, Dogs ſhall tear their own Maſters, as <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus</hi> relates the ſtory of ſome, who in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt threw the Elements in the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Dogs, and ſo were torn by them.</p>

                     <p>1. BEWARE of ſlighting <hi>Providence</hi> with reſpect to the meaneſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God, who is the higheſt, hath regard to the loweſt of creatures. <hi>Solomon</hi> was a great <note place="margin">Hic vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum vermicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum a <hi>Salomone</hi> ſublatum &amp; ſubvectum, ut homines inertes ad indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriam erudiat, eundemque non tantum doctorem conſtitutum, ſed &amp; judicem, ut ſententiam contra illos pronunciet. <hi>Cartw.</hi>

                     <p>2. Obſerve the diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> in and about the meaneſt of the creatures; and the rather, ſeeing God may otherwiſe afflict by them. A Worm doth remotely bite a <hi>Jonah</hi> to the quick. It's an inſtrument, according to the poſition of circumſtances, for his no little ſmart and vexation, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 7, 8. (2.) Much of kindneſs both negatively and poſitively, is handed by theſe creatures, as the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor doth extend his <hi>Providence</hi> in and about them. How much are men beholding to God, not only in the day-time, but in the night-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in defending them from perils by reaſon of the leaſt or meaneſt of the creatures. Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> was choak't by a Fly or Gnat. A Spider might creep into the noſtrils whilſt one is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and ſo a man might ſleep the ſleep of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101303:116"/> death. And as for poſitive kindneſs handed by theſe, inſtances have been given, and others might be made mention of. The great God, who made uſe of a great fiſh to preſerve a <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, Jonah</hi> 1. 17. can make uſe of little fiſhes for the help and relief of perſons. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Rochel</hi> (a known ſtory) were as well ſupplied by a multitude of ſhell-fiſh in the time of their ſcarcity of proviſion,on, as if ſo be a Whale had been caſt a-ſhoar amongſt them. Yea, a little fiſh may, at ſome times, be more ſubſervient for the help of diſtreſſed ones, than a greater one. I remember a pertinent ſtory, which a worthy Miniſter, now with God, told me: Some pious paſſengers were in a ſhip which had ſprang a leak; they pray, whilſt others labour at the Pump, and that to little purpoſe; till at length they eſpy the water within to be at a ſtand, and then take heart to ply the Pump, and ſo get into an Harbour; the ſhip after, in the dock, is ſearcht, and there is found a certain hole, with a fiſh commenſurate to, or exactly filling the ſaid hole. Thus, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the ſeas, and in all deep places,</hi> Pſal. 135. 6.</p>
                     <p>3. Live ſuch moral inſtructions as God is his <hi>Providence</hi> whiſpereth into our ears from the mouths of the meaneſt of his Creatures. There are two things, amongſt others, which the Scripture doth leſſon man here.</p>
                     <p>1. An induſtrious and prudent purſuit of ſuch work as God calleth unto in his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Go to the Ant, thou ſluggard, conſider her</hi>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:101303:116"/>

To conſider the Ant in a wiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our own affairs, to God's glory, and our own good, is to conſider, and be wiſe.</p>
                     <p>2. Dependance upon God both for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for a mortal life, and protection, as God ſhall be pleaſed to vouchſafe one, or the other.

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>BEFORE hath been ſhewed the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God as it reſpecteth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how they are at his beck, in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner, the meaneſt of them not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Now it may fall in the next place, To ſhew what proviſion the Lord maketh for the ſuſtentation of the Creatures, that ſtand in need of <hi>Providence</hi> as a Caterer for them, eſpecially of Mankind; for other Creatures loſe their lives as means to preſerve or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the life of Man: And here the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of God is wonderful, conſidering the vaſt extents of the Family of this world: and this appears ſo, two ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is plain aſſertion, or poſitive conceſſion, of this in Scripture. The Word is not ſilent in commending to us the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdom, Power, of God, in providing for the Creatures which are different for Kind, and many for number of each Kind.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101303:118"/> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 27, 28. <hi>Theſe wait all upon thee, that thou mayeſt give them their meat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that thou giveſt them, they gather. Thou openeſt thy hand, they are filled with good.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 15, 16. <hi>The eyes of all wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and thou giveſt them their meat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: thou openeſt thine hand, and ſatisfieſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of every living thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are particular demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this, grounded on experience of God's <hi>Providence</hi> more or leſs wonderfully diſplayed, as to his way of providing for multitudes of perſons. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs for forty years are there provided for. Their number, the place where, and the time of their being there, do all beſpeak the glorious diſplay of <hi>Providence,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth intimate, in preſſing the remembrance thereof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2, 3, 16. Our Saviour Chriſt, in feeding the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in a deſert-place, and that with five loaves and two fiſhes, gives a taſt of God's <hi>Providence</hi> in feeding vaſt multitudes in the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 15, to 22.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid here, That theſe Experiments be more than ordinary.</p>
                     <p>It may be anſwered, (1.) Theſe inſtances however, as taking place in the world in their reſpective times, fall in as a part or parcel of the ſtewardſhip of <hi>Providence;</hi> and ſo are not only as Gold-lace on the Garment of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> then, but a skirt; which, as the Lord
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101303:118"/> uſed it, did cover the body of thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Providence</hi> is notwithſtanding wonderful at other times, when bread is provided, and that enough for ſo vaſt an Houſhold. If Chriſt had put forth his Power in viſible proportion of bread and fiſh for the multitude, whether by creation, or by an inclination of the hearts of perſons to have brought in proviſion at a nick of time when to be uſed, there had been a glorious diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> theſe ways, though the bread and fiſh did not encreaſe in the breaking, diſtribution, and eating, as it did probably in Chriſt's way of feeding the multitude. That the World is provided for, is wonderful; though the manner how, be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as the Lord pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>3. Whether the <hi>Providence</hi> of God do not hold ſome kind of correſpondence with thoſe inſtances of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the multitude fed by Chriſt; may more ſafely be affirmed, than denied. There are reaſons which may turn the ſcale: for,</p>
                     <p>1. If there be a diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> in a <hi>Canaan</hi>'s becoming a Wilderneſs; why not of a Wilderneſs becoming a <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the Lord ſhall exalt the glory of his Attributes both as to the one, and to the other? If God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his bleſſing, the full Barns become empty ones. There are ways how food is made food<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: So <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Ye eat, but ye have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink: ye clothe you, but there is none warm: and he that</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:101303:119"/> 
                        <hi>earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.</hi> It is wonderful to obſerve how ſome have penury in their plenty, as others have a kind of plenty in their penury. That which is the ground of this wonderful variety, is the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. <hi>Job</hi> tells of the ſecret of God upon his Tabernacle, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 4. There is a ſecret bleſſing, and a ſecret curſe, which may be noted in the Lord's Diſpenſations.</p>
                     <p>2. What God hath done heretofore, may be a pledg of what he will do, though not after the like ſort in all particulars. God fed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs with Manna; he provided for them then, that way: if others have their Wilderneſs, his <hi>Providence</hi> may wonderfully be ſeen in taking care of them. Thus under more than ordinary difficulties, there may be more than an ordinary diſplay of <hi>Providence;</hi> and this extraordinary diſplay, may be ſaid to be ordinary, when difficult and pinching-caſes do occurr. Others, beſide the Widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> can tell ſtories by way of ſome kind of equivalent proportion, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Meal in the Barrel and the Oyl in the Cruſe not waſting and failing, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 14. they have been holpen along in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Wilderneſs; their little hath gone a great way with them: the little Buttery hath been inſtead of a large Larder and Cellar.</p>
                     <p>3. If due conſideration were had to the World, one may ſay, That it is a large Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs or Deſart, where the footſteps of the old Wilderneſs-Diſpenſation in <hi>Moſes</hi>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:101303:119"/> dayes, and the feeding of the multitude in the Deſart by Chriſt, may be traced. <hi>I verily believe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) <note place="margin">Non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt viri docti &amp; pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes qui putant plures homines in orbe terrarum vivere, quàm quotan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant &amp; nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur in agris.

                     <p>1. SEE the unbelief and atheiſm of thoſe who can ſee no other way than a bloody one for a Nation's ſubſiſtence! In the Hiſtory of the Civil-warrs of <hi>France,</hi> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that when complaints were made of barbarous and cut-throat out-rages; the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> anſwered, <hi>There is no remedy; we have too much people in France: I will deal ſo, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals may be good-cheap.</hi> This Man-of-blood little conſidered of God's <hi>Providence,</hi> which is the Store-houſe of Proviſion. Had he caſt an eye back on <hi>Providence</hi> towards <hi>Canaan</hi> a leſſer Countrey than <hi>France,</hi> he might have replied, <hi>O pray, pray, that the ſword may be turned in the plough ſhare, and the ſpear into a pruning-hook.</hi> Let Atheiſtical Politicians talk then of their bloody way; let Chriſtians remember the milky-one of obedience to God. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, if thou ſhalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve and to do all his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Lord ſhall open unto thee his good treaſure, the heaven to give thee rain unto thy land in his ſeaſon, and to bleſs all the work of thine hand—</hi> v. 12.</p>
                     <p>2. Obſerve the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in his wiſe-ordering the affairs of the great Houſe of the World. It is ſaid, that when the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had ſeen all <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wiſdom, and the Houſe that he had built, and the meat of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101303:120"/> his Table, and the ſitting of his ſervants, and the attendance of his miniſters, and their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and his Cup-bearers, and his aſcent by which he went up unto the Houſe of the Lord, there was no more ſpirit in her, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 4, 5. There is indeed greater ground for admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſtoniſhment, in beholding the order and proviſion of the great Houſe of the World: for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wiſdom by which he managed the affairs of his houſe, was but a derived drop of that <hi>Providence</hi> by which God governs the World.</p>
                     <p>3. Secure a ſpecial intereſt in the great Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the World, I mean the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. It is ſaid of pious Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> that when his Wife was making her moan to him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a large Family of Children, whom now he was about to leave to the wide world, the time of his diſſolution drawing near; that then no leſs graciouſly than wittily he replied, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God, who provideth for the young Ravens, will provide for the young</hi> Herons. Thus ſaid that Man of God; and his Family had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of God's gracious <hi>Providence</hi> towards them. It well becometh Chriſtians then to be acting faith on God's <hi>Providence</hi> for them and theirs. This is a point that our Saviour inſiſts on, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are two general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by which this duty is backt: The one is from the leſſer to the greater; <hi>If God take care for the fowls of the air, which ſow not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do reap, nor gather into barns: will he not</hi>

                        <hi>feed the children?</hi> The other is drawn from the greater to the leſs: <hi>If God be a heavenly Father, gives a Kingdom, ſpares not his own Son; will he not take care for leſſer matters, ſo far as they are needful here in this ſtate of pilgrimage?</hi> This later Argument we have implied there, and more expreſs in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. to which add that of the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected here, That many of God's children have their hardſhips; yea, ſome have been ſtarved in priſons: and therefore what doth it avail to ſecure an intereſt in God's <hi>Providence,</hi> or to act faith thereon?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. A Truth is not to be thrown by, as a Pebble, becauſe of ſome exception. It is a good rule given for the underſtanding of <hi>Solomon's Proverbs,</hi> how divers of them are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as often, or frequently, thus: The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of having Corn, is by plowing and ſowing; ſhall men throw aſide all, becauſe they have not a good-year of Corn at times. <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth God's <hi>Providence</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him from the womb, and from the breaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 9, 10. yea, he had experience of God's bounty in preparing a Table for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 5. yet a time of ſtraits he had, when he ſent to <hi>Nabal</hi> for proviſion, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Providence</hi> is a wiſe Steward. It is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the great Houſe, that ſome be put out of Commons, or kept ſhort at leaſt for a time.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:101303:121"/> 
                        <hi>My wants</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>kill my wantonneſs.</hi> It's a hard matter not to have the heart ſwell when the bags ſwell. The fat paſtures make way for exalted hearts and forgetting of God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 6. And though this be not the caſe of others, yet God hath wiſe ends in their debaſements. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                     <p>3. They who have a care to pleaſe God, have experience of God's care over them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their ſtraits. <hi>David,</hi> though deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſurly <hi>Nabal,</hi> yet had proviſion brought in by means of a wiſe <hi>Abigail. Jeremiah</hi> finds fair quarter amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> Jer. 39. 11, 12. The brethren which dwelt in <hi>Judea,</hi> had relief ſent to them in the time of the great dearth, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 28, 29. God's <hi>Providence</hi> is ſeen, as in ſtraits, ſo in the helps handed in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</p>
                     <p>4. Suppoſe ſome are ſtarved by enemies; yet what is this more (if the Lord take them out of the world this way) than to dye on their beds; when <hi>a man's life abhorreth bread, and his ſoul dainty meat,</hi> Job 33. 20. A man dyes who hath victuals but no ſtomach, as he dyes who hath a ſtomach but no victuals. Moreover God knows how to ſalve up this ſharp diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p>1. He can abate the pain and torment of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as one ſaid, <hi>If you take away my meat, God can take away my ſtomach.</hi> See <hi>Exod</hi> 34 28.</p>
                     <p>2. The Lord may then feaſt them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of meat, as Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>John</hi> 4. 32.</p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:101303:122"/>

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>AS God's <hi>Providence</hi> is ſeen in making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the world: ſo in bearing down ſin in the World. The World would quickly be reſolved into a Chaos or heap of confuſion, did not the <hi>Providence</hi> of God exert it ſelf, and that particularly in and about the ſins of men; who having ſince the fall of our firſt Parents deſtructive Principles wrapt up in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, would certainly give the product of ſuch Principles in black and bloody Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were there not a <hi>Providence</hi> which did counter work them, by bearing down ſin; and theſe ways, amongſt others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> By uſhering in good tidings of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for whoſe ſake the World is ſpared from deſtruction; for time is now vouchſafed for the ingathering of a choſen generation. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and ſo all mankind, were dead in law; Judgment was to take place; Chriſt, the Seed of the Woman, ſteps in, becomes a Surety, and bruiſeth the head of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>He ſhall</hi> (ſaid the Angel to <hi>Joſeph</hi>) <hi>ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:101303:123"/> tares then are ſpared, till the Wheat be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 29, 30.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By an inward work of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promoted in the hearts of redeemed ones by Chriſt, <hi>who</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2. 14.</p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold bearing down of ſin here to be conſidered:</p>
                     <p>1. A bearing of it down in Saints: for they are juſtified by Chriſt, and ſanctified by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. a ſtop is put to ſin in them; yea, to ſuch ſins which were deſtructive to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety; for ſuch ſins were to be found amongſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> before converſion, in regard of their reigning power, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11, of the ſame Chapter.</p>
                     <p>2. Bearing of it down by Saints; and that,</p>
                     <p>1. In regard of their common and general Calling, as Chriſtians: ſo they do, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are to live it down, and pray it down in others. The beſt Saint may contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as a poliſh't ſhaft in the hand of the Lord to wound ſin. The Lord in his <hi>Providence</hi> hath caſt Saints as Salt up and down the World; and were it not for this Salt, there would be ſuch an ill ſavour, that it would be time to ſet the World on fire. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>2. In regard of ſome Calling ſpecial: and ſo,</p>
                     <p>1. As Magiſtrates: Theſe, as Saints, are to uſe their authority and power for Chriſt. <hi>Job</hi>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:101303:123"/> brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluck't the ſpoil out of his teeth, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 17. <hi>When I</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>ſhall receive the congregation, I will judg uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 75. 2.</p>
                     <p>2. As Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, who may be ſaid to bear down ſin,</p>
                     <p>1. In regard of the real converſion of ſome. Sin receives a killing-blow from the preaching of the word; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
                     <p>2. In regard of moral illumination of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereby ſome, for a time at leaſt, are curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. Notorious evils are the proper fruit of the Tree of Ignorance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. with chap. 4. v. 3, 4. The very checking in of vile luſts, may give a check to terrible Judgments, which break in on perſons and places otherwiſe. The filthy luſt of ſome of the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> made ſoul work amongſt their Tribe. Their burning-luſts ended in the burning of their City: ſee <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 25. with <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 40.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By way of prevention. Though men have a ſeed-plot of ſin in their hearts, yet ſome of the ſeeds at ſome times lye there as dead. So in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 24. <hi>I will caſt out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any man deſire thy land when thou ſhalt go to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.</hi> God hath variety of ways to huſh and ſtill the cry of Robbery, Spoil, and Cruelty. He who made the Soul of man, knows how to have acceſs to the door of every affliction, and ſo to ſet a lock and key on it.</p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:101303:124"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By way of inhibition. There are the ſtirrings of ſin, but they are but ſtirrings. The ſhackles of reſtraint are clapt on by <hi>Providence.</hi> Luſt hath conceived, but it bringeth not forth, to allude to that in <hi>James</hi> 1. 15. The birth of the Project is an abortive. Now how <hi>Providence</hi> doth block up the luſts of men, ſo that though there be conſultation and reſolution, yet the deſign walks not abroad into the field, but is confined within doors, may call for our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration rather than diſcuſſion. A comprehenſive recital of the many ways which <hi>Providence</hi> hath to lay ſiege to the hearts of men, is not to be expected. It's not for a Cock-ſhell-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to take in the Ocean. A few drops then of that River which <hi>Providence</hi> cuts a channel or trench for the keeping in of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo that they ſally not out, and do that miſchief which might be done, may here be put together, and that in the Veſſel of the Sanctuary, I mean according to Scripture.</p>
                     <p>1. There is a way of inhibition, which I may term excentrical, or extraordinary. And that there is an inhibition, is clear; but how, is as dark to be underſtood. He who formeth the ſpirit of man within him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 1. can and doth byaſs it as he pleaſeth. The Lord hath ſecret and immediate acceſſes to the hearts of men.</p>
                     <p>2. There is a way which is more ordinary, as in ſome meaſure apprehended or underſtood by men. And this way whereby God doth often inhibit ſin, is by ſome impreſſions or other, which are made on the ſpirits of men. And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101303:124"/> here it may be obſerved, (1.) An impreſſion is made by the light of Nature, being blown up into a flame at ſuch an inſtant by ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work of God. The Heathens <hi>having not a law, were a law to themſelves,</hi> Rom. 2. 14. They were Heathens who ſhewed no little kindneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 2. they did not knock the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack't perſons in the head, but their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion was drawn forth towards them. (2.) An impreſſion is ſometimes made by means of a conviction of a party's honeſty or innocency, againſt whom fury was armed. <hi>David</hi> gives <hi>Saul</hi> to underſtand, that he was no ſuch Male-content and enemy to him, as he was traduced by a pack of Claw-backs and Sycophants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Saul:</hi> he lets him know, as a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his good affection to <hi>Saul,</hi> That he had opportunity to have killed his Majeſty; but far was it from him to do ſo, though near enough to have done ſo: far, in a moral ſenſe; near, in a local ſenſe. And hereupon ſaith <hi>Saul, I have ſinned: return, my ſon David, for I will no more do thee harm, becauſe my ſoul was precious in thine eyes: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly,</hi> 1 Sam. 26. 21.</p>
                     <p>3. An impreſſion is made by reaſon of fear; and that (1.) From the Laws or Conſtitutions of the Countrey where perſons live. The Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, more than Conſcience, is a Lion in the ſinner's way. Good Laws in a Nation, are the hedg and fence which keep off many a wild beaſt from making a prey on others; they who are lions couchant, would be Lions rampant otherwiſe. <hi>Take heed what thou doſt</hi> (ſaid the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101303:125"/> Centurion to the chief Captain, of <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>for this man is a Roman,</hi> Acts 22. 26. (2.) From the diſpleaſure of friends and relations. Some would keep up a greater friendſhip with ſome ſins, were it not that their friends ſmiles would be turned into frowns. <hi>Micah</hi> continues not on his theft, but makes peace with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he had wronged, and whoſe curſe he feared, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 1, 2, 3. (3.) From re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtances or examples of Divine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. God in his <hi>Providence</hi> ſingles out ſome in a way of puniſhment, and ſo they become a terror to others. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> are ſtruck dead; <hi>great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard theſe things,</hi> Acts 5. 11. In ſome places, where people have not had ſuch means of illumination by the full and clear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Scriptures; yet there is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance from ſome ſins, even to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And what is the bridle, but remarkable puniſhments which have befallen Adulterers, Murderers, and Perjured perſons, and the like? There is much of a Catechizing-Providence to be obſerved this way. (4) From what may after be repaid home by parties themſelves, or their friends, in caſe perſons take not wit in their anger againſt ſuch. <hi>David</hi> wills <hi>Saul</hi>'s Courtiers to leave off their lying inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is probable in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 2. the wind might ſet at another point, and then what becomes of them? <hi>Gideon</hi> tells <hi>Zebah</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna, They</hi> (who were ſlain by them at <hi>Tabor</hi>) <hi>were my brethren, even the ſons of my mother: as the Lord liveth, if ye had ſaved them alive, I would not ſlay</hi>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:101303:125"/> 
                        <hi>you,</hi> Judg. 8. 18, 19. Some are awed this way, as <hi>Gideon</hi>'s ſpeech may imply, though others are not. <hi>Abuer</hi> had a ſenſe of this in that ſpeech of his to <hi>Aſahel, Turn thee aſide</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>from following me; wherefore ſhould I ſmite thee to the ground? how then ſhould I hold up my face to Joah thy brother?</hi> 2 Sam. 2. 22.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, Providence</hi> bears down ſin by way of limitation. The Lord ſets bounds unto the raging-ſea of corruption. An arm of it flows in, and it is but an arm; righteouſly ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and yet wiſely limited by the hand of God. <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s counſel takes effect in <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>'s defiling his father's Concubines, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>Providence</hi> herein makes good the truth of the word ſpoken, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 11. Howbeit, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi>'s counſel takes not in purſuing after <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 17. 14. <hi>Shimei</hi> had malice enough in his heart to have ſtain'd his hands with the blood of a good King, by way of aſſaſſination; but he only rails, and throws ſtones at <hi>David</hi> and his ſervants, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By way of detection, which puts a ſtop ſometimes in ſome caſes. <hi>Eſau</hi> hated <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>The days of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I ſlay my brother Jacob; and theſe words of Eſau her elder ſon, were told Rebeccah,</hi> Gen. 27. 41, 42. <hi>Jacob</hi> hereupon is ſent away from his father's houſe, <hi>v.</hi> 43, 44, 45. but more of this in the next Obſervation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> By way of regulation, or convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the ſins of men to a good uſe. As there is a myſtery of iniquity; ſo there is a myſtery of <hi>Providence</hi> in and about
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:101303:126"/> ſin. Phyſicians know how to make uſe of a Viper for the good of their Patients. The All-wiſe God knows how to make uſe of the Vipers of the world, with their venom. <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> By way of deſtruction, (1.) Of the Power of men. (2.) Of Men in power. It may be obſerved how the ability to hurt is broken, abſolutely, or comparatively. <hi>Shebna</hi> the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer is to be diſcarded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 19. <hi>Ariſe, O Lord,</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>for thou haſt ſmitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, thou haſt broken the teeth of the ungodly,</hi> Pſal. 3. 7. <hi>Providence</hi> hands them a ſhaming-blow, for that ſeems to be meant by ſmiting on the cheek. They are box't and kick't to their diſgrace. Their teeth are broken; and no need to fear their teethleſs jaws. Or if they are not formally or properly ſo broken, yet equivalently. Suppoſe they have Power, Wealth, with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice enough; yet all avails not, for they are check't by a greater Power. Thus the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Darius</hi> for building the Temple, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenceth whatever prejudices and hatred might be amongſt the under-officers of the King, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Hither may be referred inflicted diſeaſes, as hereby men are more or leſs diſabled or incapacitated for the commiſſion of ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 6, 17.</p>
                     <p>Again, As <hi>Providence</hi> deſtroys the Power of men, ſo Men in power. When men become monſtrous in ſinning, no wonder if God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come prodigious in puniſhing. <hi>Providence</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101303:126"/> the good of Societies of men, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe to breathe their laſt, who have made others to groan under their inſolent Oppreſſions, or oppreſſing Inſolencies.</p>
                     <p>There are three ways how <hi>Providence</hi> bears down ſin by bearing down the ſinner to his grave:</p>
                     <p>1. By his own hands. The Lord arms ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners judicially againſt themſelves. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their own Executioners. <hi>Achitophel</hi> hangs himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 23. So <hi>Judas</hi> too, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 5.</p>
                     <p>2. By the hands of others. One wild beaſt gores another to death. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> is ſlain, and <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Median</hi> took the Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 30, 31.</p>
                     <p>3. By a more immediate hand of God. Dead they are; and a Jury ſay ſomething, by ſaying nothing as to any viſible-creature-hand by which death came. God who gave life, hath many ways to take what is given. He hath his Quiver full of Arrows. Not only a ſilent Arrow, but a ſudden one, doth execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Pſal. 64. 7. <hi>God ſhall ſhoot at them with an arrow, ſuddenly ſhall they be wounded.</hi>

                     <p>1. LEARN to whom the glory of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the World, is due. God's <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is the true <hi>Atlas</hi> which ſupport the World, that doth ſhoulder up the World, whilſt it treads on ſin and ſinners. Upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious view taken of <hi>Providence</hi> on this wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, we may ſay as they ſaid, <hi>The Lord he is the God; the Lord he is the God,</hi> 1 King. 18. 39.</p>
                     <p>2. Obſerve an Argument to confirm the truth of God's <hi>Providence</hi> in governing the World, from the reſtraints put upon ſin and ſinners in the World. The reſtraints do then beſpeak the more remarkable hand of God, (1.) When parties reſtrain'd have power in their hand. A wonder it was, that none of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Life-guard did not knock in the head thoſe ſaucy and buſie fellows <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as they were look't on in the judgment of the Court, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 4, 5. (2.) When there is an old grudg againſt parties. Anger becomes canker'd malice; and yet the Canker eats no farther. As in <hi>Eſau</hi>'s inveterate hatred againſt <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 37. 41. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 33 (3.) When God ſhall ſtep in in a nick of time, and clap on the ſhackles of reſtraint. <hi>The God of your fathers</hi> (ſaid <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>ſpake unto me ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-night, ſaying, Take thou heed that thou ſpeak not to Jacob either good or bad,</hi> Gen. 31. 29. ſo in <hi>Eſau</hi>'s caſe, who comes forth againſt <hi>Jacob</hi> with his four hundred men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 6. (4.) When
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:101303:127"/> the Dogs are not only muzled, but ſhall fawn upon the Children. <hi>Eſau</hi> ran to meet <hi>Jacob,</hi> and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him, and they wept, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 4. God in his <hi>Providence</hi> doth wonderfully affect the hearts of Aliens from Religion, ſo as they are kind <note place="margin">Noſtro quoque tempore factum eſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ut praefecti, alieni à noſtra religione, melius ſe geſſerint erga Evangelicos, quam illi ipſi, qui eandem nobiſcum doctrinam profeſſi ſunt. <hi>Lavat.</hi> in lib. Eld. Homil. 16.</note> to the religious. <hi>Tatnai</hi> and <hi>Sethar-bozni,</hi> are not as the former Officers, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. compared with chap. 4.</p>
                     <p>3. Have recourſe to the great God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for the bearing down of ſinners. The Lord hath two Bitts; the golden-one of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-grace, and the iron-one of Reſtraints. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> prays, and <hi>Paul</hi> is converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 60. with <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prays, and he hath ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of an iron Bit: there is an hook for the noſe, and a bridle for the lips of a menacing and thundering <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 14, 15. with 28.</p>
                     <p>4. Take thankful-notice of God's reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Providence. (1.) The neglect may provoke God to let ſlip the Bridle of Reſtraint. The Lord may teach the worth of a Mercy by the want of the ſaid Mercy. If the Lord do but hiſs for the Fly of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and for the Bee of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> they quickly come to the annoyance of people, who were before free from annoyance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 18, 19, 20. (2.) There is much of God to be ſeen in the reſtraint of perſons. This
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101303:128"/> Jewel is worthy of more than a ſingle caſt of the eye. Saints owe their Eſtates, Lives, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining-Providence. <hi>Jacob</hi> could ſee the face of God in the face of his brother <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 33. 10.</p>
                     <p>5. Secure a ſhare in Regenerating-grace. For, (1.) This is the kernel and cream of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Without Grace a man is but a tame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil at the beſt. Corn, and Wine, and Oil, make men joyll; but it's the light of God's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which makes truly glad, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. (2.) He who hath Regenerating-Providence for his portion, will not be without a large ſhare in Reſtraining-Providence for his protection. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>both lay me down in peace, and ſleep; for thou, Lord, makeſt me to dwell in ſafety,</hi> Pſal. 4. 8.<note place="margin">Unde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam juſti taberna, tygurium &amp; tento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium ad omnem adverſam &amp; noxiam vim propulſandam plus virium ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, quam improborum robuſtiſſimum &amp; firmiſſimum palatium, arces, propugnacula: juſtorum papyracei parietes improborum ferreis &amp; aeneis; illorum ſtraminea lectorum integumenta, horum laminis ac tegulis; illorum ligamina, horum ſeris &amp; peſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>BEFORE, was ſhewed how <hi>Providence</hi> bears down ſin in the world; and one way, amongſt others, was by way of detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſcovery. Hereby, ſin intended, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prevented; as the killing of <hi>Paul</hi> by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Jews, who had banded together to do the fact, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hereby ſome are made examples of ſhame, that ſo others may be deterred from giving way to like abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi>'s caſe; <hi>great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard theſe things,</hi> Acts 5. 11. <hi>Providence</hi> then is very remarkable in the diſ-vizzarding men; and this appears two ways:</p>
                     <p>1. From expreſs and implied aſſertions, or cautions bottomed on aſſertions. Job 12. 22. <hi>He diſcovereth deep things out of darkneſs: and bringeth out to light the ſhadow of death.</hi> And Eccleſ. 10. 20. <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought; and curſe not the rich in thy bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: for a bird of the air ſhall carry the voice; and that which hath wings ſhall tell the matter.</hi> So
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101303:129"/> Luke 8. 17. <hi>For nothing is ſecret, that ſhall not be made manifeſt; neither any thing hid, that ſhall not be known and come abroad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. From Exemplifications; which may be diſtinguiſh't according to deeds of darkneſs; which are ſo termed; as ſin within is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to darkneſs, and Satan the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are both Mother and Nurſe to ſuch deeds in the general: But more particularly, and to the matter in hand, in regard of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, as affecting the dark, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11, 12. Theſe deeds of darkneſs do reſpect the firſt Table and ſecond, in a way of violation of duties commanded. Now each of theſe ſort of deeds of darkneſs are brought to light.</p>
                     <p>1. Examples there are of the firſt ſort. Our firſt Parents ſinned againſt God in eating the forbidden fruit; the Lord himſelf plays the <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> and lays open the bowels of that fact, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>&amp;c. Achan</hi>'s tranſgreſſing the Covenant, is found out, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 11, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Judas</hi> his Hypocriſie ends in notorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 14. 15. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira's</hi> Sacriledg hath the Curtain drawn from before it, by the hand of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 5. <hi>Simon Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. Examples of the later ſort there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>The eye that mocketh at his father, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley ſhall pick it out, and the young eagles ſhall eat it,</hi> Prov. 30. 17. <hi>Cain</hi>'s murdering his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> is found out by the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Judah</hi>'s Uncleanneſs hath a Signet, and Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101303:129"/> and Staff, to diſcover it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 16, 24, 25. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſtoln out of the Land of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. 15. the Plagiariſm or Theft of the Brethren is laid open. The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forgery and perjury in the caſe of <hi>Naboth,</hi> is left on record, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. Theſe inſtances of both ſorts may ſuffice. It were eaſie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large here from Hiſtory. I paſs to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation or improvement.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. OBSERVE an Argument to prove <hi>Providence,</hi> from the wonderful diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries which are made of the deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Though all deeds of darkneſs do not come to light in this world; yet this may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Divers do: ſome are diſcovered to prove a <hi>Providence;</hi> others reſerved from a diſcovery, to intimate a day of general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are ſeveral Obſervables, which, if they are ſeriouſly conſidered, do abundantly commend to us the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature.</p>
                     <p>1. The ſmall and various threads on which a diſcovery doth ſometimes hang. Unleſs the hand of <hi>Providence</hi> did faſten theſe together, and keep them from being broken, the ſinner had not been drawn out of his Dungeon by them. How many windings and turnings were there of <hi>Providence,</hi> ere the horrid fact of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s brethren comes to their father's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg?</p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:101303:130"/>
                     <p>2. The long diſtance of time ſometimes between the perpetration of ſome fact, and the diſcovery of it. One would think ſuch or ſuch a deed of darkneſs were dead, buried, and never like to riſe again in this world. There were divers years paſt ere <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren were taken to task by <hi>Providence</hi> in order to a diſcovery. I could inſtance in a woman who liv'd thirty years after a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed; and the Houſe where ſhe liv'd being after to be altered, in regard it was not convenient for the making of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, being twice blown up; in digging, bones were found: and the Woman, who had changed her habitation, was apprehended, and convicted out of her own confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>3. The notable ſagacity and quick-ſighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome who are concerned to ſearch into matters. There is ſometimes much of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to be noted. Counſel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of underſtanding will draw it out, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 5. In the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of the Harlots about the living-child, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Judgment was more ſharp than his Sword, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 16, to the end.</p>
                     <p>4. Angelical Miniſtry, which <hi>Providence</hi> doth often uſe in order to diſcoveries. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an Angel of the Lord, how <hi>Herod</hi> had a deſign to murder Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 13. I make no queſtion, but the Angels who cover their faces before the Almighty, do inviſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover many a deed of darkneſs. They are the Intelligencers in matters of this nature. And though they do not appear in places of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101303:130"/> yet they may aſſiſt there, and promote (inviſibly) Diſcoveries. I have heard of one who had an Apparition, which willed him to accuſe a certain party of Murder commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and withal, bid the man ask certain que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; and in caſe the proof did not take, the Spirit would appear in the place of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature: On the rumour of this, a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there is of people to behold the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition; and out of the Croud, Witneſſes are found to evince the murderous fact; for the queſtions referring to the Murder, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through ſuch an hedg, waſhing his ſhooes at ſuch a place, being denied, ſome there did on the contrary atteſt, being thus providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawn together with others; and ſo the Judg condemns the man, not becauſe of the Apparition, but upon proof made <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. The variety of ways which <hi>Providence</hi> hath to lay open the deeds of darkneſs. <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> doth ſometimes blow off the paint by the warm breath of the guilty parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their own conſciences, words, carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, witneſs the evils committed. <hi>Many came, and confeſſed, and ſhewed their deeds,</hi> Acts 19. 18, 19. Again, ſometimes by the breath of others, who if they were not Aſſociates, yet were ſome way or other privy to ſuch deeds. A <hi>Jehu</hi> tells ſtories of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Court, and what paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 25, 26.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, <hi>Providence</hi> doth make good the charge againſt the guilty, ſometimes by ſome one ſingle demonſtrative or paſſage. <hi>Tamar</hi>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:101303:131"/> ſends a greeting to her father, ſaying, <hi>By the man whoſe theſe are, am I with child,</hi> Gen. 38. 25. Again, ſometime by a concurrency of matters. A bundle of ſticks is not broken, though taken apart they are eaſily ſnapt aſunder. <hi>Providence</hi> is wonderful, in bringing forth the ſeveral links of the Chain, which pull the Guilty out of their cloſe Coverts, to their bluſh and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of face.</p>
                     <p>2. Give not way to Abominations upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſecrecy. It is folly, and a deluſion of Satan, to conſent to temptations, becauſe of ſecrecy.</p>
                     <p>1. Suppoſe the guilts of ſome eſcape the eye of men in this world, Art thou ſure that thine ſhall? The Lord ſeeth all, and may give others to ſee what thou doſt. <hi>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the ſorcerers, and againſt the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and againſt falſe ſwearers, and againſt thoſe that oppreſs the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherleſs, and that turn aſide the ſtranger from his right, and fear not me, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal 3. 5. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 21. <hi>Shall not God ſearch this out? for he knoweth the ſecrets of the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. There is an heavy judgment on parties, in their uncontrollable liberty which they take in the Vaults of darkneſs. The hand of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> lies heavy on them in a judiciary way, whilſt the finger of <hi>Providence</hi> doth not point out to the world their ſins, for which they might take an holy ſhame, and amend. 'Twas a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101303:131"/> mercy to <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent to him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. On the other hand, <hi>Providence</hi> doth puniſh, when it doth not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 14. To go on in the broad-way to deſtruction without check, is the ſuburbs of damnation.</p>
                     <p>3. A day will come when all will out before Angels and Men. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>In the day when God ſhall judg the ſecrets of men according to my Goſpel.</hi> And 1 Cor. 4. 5. <hi>Therefore judg nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts; and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</hi> To this of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, add what <hi>Solomon</hi> hath as pertinent for a period here; and oh that it might put a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to further deeds of darkneſs: <hi>Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man: for God ſhall bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 13, 14.</p>

                     <p>AS there is a general inſpection of God over all the Creatures, as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed: ſo there is a more ſpecial over Man, the Flower of the Creation, next to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.

                     <p>2. It's acknowledged by the Lord's people in their addreſſes to him. <hi>But thou art he that took me out of the womb; thou didſt make me hope when I was upon my mothers breaſt: I was caſt upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mothers belly,</hi> Pſal. 22. 9, 10. <hi>O God, thou haſt taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared thy wondrous works: now alſo when I am old, and gray-headed, O God forſake me not,</hi> Pſal. 71. 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>3. Otherwiſe that Principle of undoubted Verity, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Acts 17. 28. would expire before man breathe out his laſt. If there be not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant motion of <hi>Providence</hi> from life to death, the ſenſe muſt be, In him we live not, move not, and have not our being.</p>
                     <p>4. The Scripture deſcends particularly, (1.) To the Actions of man. (2.) To what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls man, and that by way of reference to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God:</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>1. As Natural, as eating, drinking, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, talking, ſleeping, theſe are ſubjected to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. They are like to make but a poor meal, who have both mouths and meat, if they find not grace in the eyes of the Lord. <hi>While the fleſh was yet between the teeth of the Iſraelites, yer it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the people,</hi> Numb. 11. 33. <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf: it is not in man that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to direct his ſteps,</hi> Jer. 10. 23. <hi>But I will come</hi>

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> reads to buyers and ſellers a good and ſavoury lecture; he willeth them to eye <hi>Providence;</hi> for though they are Maſters of their own Trade, yet not Maſters of their own Lives; and what becomes of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bargains then in a moment? yea, of what they have gotten through ſucceeding. <hi>Providence,</hi> when they are ſwept away by death, which proves at times the death of their Wealth; their Eſtates, and Affairs, lying raw, and undigeſted, and being left in the hands of Fools, or Knaves? See <hi>James</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>3. As Moral; and that whether good or bad. As for actions good; no man, unleſs he he forget himſelf to be a man, will appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate that to himſelf as a Fountain, of which he is but a Ciſtern: <hi>for who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. See <hi>James</hi> 1. 17. And as for actions bad, which are vulgarly ſo termed; though <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> be not an author of them, yet it is a ſpotleſs actor in and about them: the foul acts in a man's lame-foot, and yet lameneſs

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> What befalls man, is reducible to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God.

                     <p>1. LOOK back how <hi>Providence</hi> hath dealt with thee in time paſt. <hi>Jacob</hi> did ſo, as is left on record, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Man of God, in the book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which may may be termed the book of <hi>Moſes</hi> Farewel-Sermons, preach't a Month before his death (as ſome obſerve), doth commend to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> a ſurvey of God's <hi>Providence</hi> towards them; he willeth them particularly to take a view both of Mercies and Afflictions. <hi>Thy raiment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>waxed not old upon thee; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did thy foot ſwell theſe forty years: thou ſhalt alſo conſider in thine heart, that as a man cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth his ſon, ſo the Lord thy God chaſteneth thee,</hi> Deut. 8. 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>2. Take encouragement for time to come, to truſt in God. Some are miſerably baffled
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101303:134"/> with temptations for futurity; How ſhall they do! What may befall them, and the like! here is both an Antidote and a Remedy againſt this Diſeaſe. <hi>Providence</hi> runs parallel with the line of life; and this may quiet and compoſe the ſpirit, if well thought on and improved, But more particularly conſider here three things.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Providence</hi> is not tired. It is a mighty Giant, not wearied with half-racing. <hi>Haſt thou not known? haſt thou not heard, that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary,</hi> Iſa, 40. 28.</p>
                     <p>2. The experience of an <hi>hitherto</hi>-Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may ſweetly invite to wait on God for futurity. So <hi>David</hi> reaſoneth, <hi>Thou art my Lamp, O Lord: and the Lord will lighten my darkneſs: for by thee I have run thorow a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall,</hi> 2 Sam. 22. 29, 30. <hi>So Paul</hi> too, 2 Cor. 1. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>3. The Promiſes are not empty breaſts. There is enough in them to keep faith from ſtarving. Remember that, Heb. 13. 5. <hi>Let your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have; for he hath ſaid, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>BEFORE was ſhewed, how <hi>Providence</hi> runs hand in hand, as it were, with man, from the Cradle to the Crutch of old age; a Race there is from the birth, even to death.

                     <p>1. From God's manner of appearing to, and for, the Patriarchs of old. There were ſome certain and eminent ſeaſons for ſuch appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.

                     <p>3. From the Attributes of God, the glory whereof in an eminent manner the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults at ſome ſeaſons. All the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> nights were not nights of obſervation, in compariſon of that night when the ſtarrs of God's Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes did ſo gloriouſly ſhine in their going forth from <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 41, 42.

From the object-matter of ſuch Sallies, Excurſions, or Diſplays of <hi>Providence.</hi> The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may be conſidered in regard of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and ſpirituals. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God, like a glorious Sun, caſts its beam on each of

                     <p>4. The wonderful ſympathy and conſonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">Rari ſunt quibus non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtidia ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum. <hi>Calv.</hi>
                        </note> of affection between parties, and that though, there are other men and other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which in regard of beauty, parts, and wealth, may rather commend them. The two are one fleſh (<hi>Gen</hi> 2. 24.) not only in regard of the Lord's Inſtitution, but love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the main kept up. To theſe things may be added the ſignal diſplays of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of Children, the fruit of Marriage. There is a remark diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in not having them. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 30. <hi>This ſaith the Lord, Write this man childleſs,</hi> &amp;c. And there is, on the other hand, as remark a diſplay in the having of them; as in <hi>Sarah</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 18 14. <hi>Hannah</hi> a <hi>Samu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>l,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 20. with <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> Luke 1. 13. with 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in order to the converſion of parties to God, or goodneſs. <hi>Paul</hi> makes a narrative how the good Shepherd brought home the loſt ſheep, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. He declares there what he was by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101303:138"/> and what he is by grace. He who was the High-Prieſt's Blood-hound, becomes a Lamb of Chriſt's Fold. Free-grace was eminently diſplayed in his converſion; for the very time of his rage and madneſs againſt the people of God, was the time of God's dropping grace into his heart. Chriſt then planted him on <hi>Zion</hi>'s ground, when he intended to root up Chriſtians. Here I might inſiſt on, (1.) The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, means remote and near. (2.) The time when. (3.) The manner how <hi>Providence</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about the calling home of parties. But this might prove too large an Excurſion in this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of mortification-work, or progreſs in the ways of God. The Houſe of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> is not built as ſoon as the foundation is laid. There is <hi>growth in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> required, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. How the Lord doth promote this work, may in brief be touched in three things:</p>
                     <p>1. By way of diſcovery of ſlips and ſinful imprudencies, even after converſion. Even a <hi>David</hi> needs a <hi>Nathan</hi> to alarum him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and though ſome do not fall ſo foully as <hi>David</hi> did, in regard of heinous ſins; yet the ſinful imprudencies after converſion, are matter for humiliation. The breakings forth of ſpiritual pride, raſhneſs, cenſoriouſneſs, and ſuch like evils, unto which young Converts or weak Chriſtians are incident, have a day of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Court of <hi>Providence.</hi> The brighter and clearer the Sun breaks in at the Window,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101303:139"/> the better is diſcerned a ſmall object, as a pin on the ground. At firſt, when the Chriſtian's Sun did not ſhine ſo clear, he diſcerned groſſer evils; but now he comes to behold more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual evils.</p>
                     <p>2. By exerciſing them with variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Theſe Soldiers know what it is to be in gariſon, and what it is to be in the field. They have had both calms and ſtorms on the Sea of this World. Witneſſes hereof, are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jacob, Moſes, David, Job, Paul,</hi> with others. Theſe had their divers temptations or trials, as is ſaid <hi>James</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                     <p>3. By quickning them to the uſe of means, in order to progreſs. <hi>As new born babes, deſire ye the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby,</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 2. The Spouſe ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him whom her ſoul loveth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And for her ſpiritual lazineſs and drowſineſs, Chriſt had withdrawn himſelf; and then ſhe is the more ſecretly ſtirred up to ſeek after him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. Pertinent to this, is that of <hi>Jude</hi>'s direction for progreſs; <hi>But ye beloved, building up your ſelves in your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto eternal life,</hi> Jude <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of Temptations which befall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. There are certain buffeting ſeaſons when Satan is let looſe, and that not without a wiſe and righteous hand of God. Thus in <hi>David</hi>'s numbring the people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. It is ſaid, <hi>Then was Jeſus led up of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:101303:139"/> 
                        <hi>into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil,</hi> Mat. 4. 1. And as there is a buffeting-ſeaſon; ſo there is a relieving ſally of <hi>Providence</hi> more than ordinary, when the temptation is ſo. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not,</hi> Luke 22. 31, 32. Though <hi>Peter</hi> fell, and that foully; yet, as he fell by his riſing too high in his own confidence, <hi>v.</hi> 33. ſo he riſes from his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>v.</hi> 62. and by his falling; for he becomes a more humble Chriſtian afterwards, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. To this inſtance of <hi>Peter,</hi> add that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of Calamities. Theſe are not the birth of Heatheniſh Fortune or Chance. <hi>See now</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that I, even I, am be; and there is no God with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver out of my hand,</hi> Deut. 31. 39. The black Horſe, and the red Horſe, and the pale Horſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. were (if I may ſo phraſe it) ſadled in the Stable of <hi>Providence,</hi> ere <hi>Providence</hi> rid cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit in way of Judgment on them. <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> may be ſtiled the Maſter of theſe Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for upon the opening of the ſeals, away gallop theſe Horſes, that is, wrathful Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, to take place in the World, according to the Contents of the ſealed Book there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of external Mercies; of which, perſons are in an eminent way made the ſubjects of. There is a plain ſtamp on this Coin; the image
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101303:140"/> or ſuperſcription of <hi>Providence</hi> is very legible. <hi>Abimilech,</hi> and <hi>Pichol</hi> the chief Captain of his Army, come to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>We ſaw certainly that the Lord is with thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 28, 29. It is ſaid of <hi>David, He went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of Hoſts was with him. Hiram,</hi> King of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> ſends meſſengers to him; yea, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Lord had eſtabliſhed him King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he had exalted his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for his people <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſake, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. <hi>When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream; then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging: then ſaid they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them,</hi> Pſal. 126. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tenthly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of Habitation. <hi>Now the Lord had ſaid unto Abraham, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's houſe, unto a land that I will ſhew thee,</hi> Gen. 12. 1. <hi>Jacob</hi> hath a call to leave <hi>Laban,</hi> to be gone from him, whoſe countenance was not toward him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 2, 3. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt no longer keep the Flock of his Father <hi>Jethro;</hi> he muſt look after another Flock, the Lord's people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Then ſpake Eliſha to the woman (whoſe ſon he had reſtored to life) ſaying, Ariſe, and go thou and thy houſhold, and ſojourn whereſoever thou canſt ſojourn: for the Lord hath called for a famine, and it ſhall alſo come upon the land ſeven years,</hi> 2 King 8. 1. <hi>The Angel of the Lord apppeareth to Joſeph in a dream, ſaying, Ariſe and take the young child, and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and he</hi>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:101303:140"/> 
                        <hi>thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will ſeek the young child to deſtroy him,</hi> Mat. 2. 13. Thus there is a diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> in the change of Habitation; and they who change their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces according as there is a warrant or rational ground ſo to do, have experience, that though they change their places, yet not their God. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> though he left his Father's Family, yet met with his Father's God elſewhere, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in regard of Journeys. This is of ſome kin to the former, and yet a difference there is. The Bee goes abroad, yet keeps to the old Hive. Some are not ſo coop'd up at their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiomed homes, but there are occaſions and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional inducements to be abroad. Now <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is on its journey, whilſt they are on theirs. A wonderful <hi>Providence</hi> there was in the journey of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſons into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 42. 1, 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hey go down into <hi>Egypt</hi> for Corn, and ſo the Sheaf-dream is fulfilled, and they are there threſhed from their chaff, <hi>v.</hi> 9, and 21. <hi>Joſeph</hi> by a good <hi>Providence</hi> is found by a man, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he was wandring in the field, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his journey to <hi>Egypt,</hi> meets with a ſtartling-<hi>Providence, Exod.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Eliſha</hi> in his journey at <hi>Shunem,</hi> meets with courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainment, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Ezra</hi>'s journey of Prayer, proves a journey of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Ezra</hi> 8. 21, 23. It is ſaid of Chriſt, he muſt go thorow <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4. 4. As there might be reaſon for his going thorow <hi>Samaria,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſcituation of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that being
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101303:141"/> the way to the place intended; ſo there might be another reaſon, namely, his will for the converſion of the woman there, together with her neighbours, <hi>v.</hi> 39. Thus from theſe and the like Scriptures it may be evidenced, how there is much of <hi>Providence</hi> in journeys, and that both as to Temporals and Spirituals, Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Mercies. It's wiſdom to take God along with one in journeys on earth, and to mind the great journey towards Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in regard of ſome glorious Diſcovery of God to the Soul by way of conſolation. Every day is not in this ſenſe a Chriſtian's gaudee-day. <hi>Jacob</hi> had a golden dream indeed, when in it, <hi>Behold I am with thee, and will keep thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 15. That paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſignal <hi>Providence</hi> was never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by <hi>Jacob;</hi> it was of uſe to him thorow his whole life: it was not an every-day's <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> though he had experience of God's <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> every day. In 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 9. God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing twice to <hi>Solomon</hi> is there taken notice of. <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the third Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. I make no queſtion but divers Saints of God have had ſomewhat like experience of God's out-goings towards their ſouls. There are ſome high-days of <hi>Providence,</hi> if I may ſo term them; and oh that ſuch high-days (where and when they are) may not puff up perſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of Death; and that as they reſpect,</p>
                     <p>1. The fore-running, warning, preparatory-intimations
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101303:141"/> of Death. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſang ſweetly, like Swans, before their death. Chriſt obſerves that <hi>Providence</hi> in the woman's anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his feet with ointment of Spikenard; <hi>Let her alone</hi> (ſaid he to grumbling <hi>Judas</hi>): <hi>againſt the day of my burying hath ſhe kept this,</hi> Joh. 12. 7. <note place="margin">Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Engliſh-Generals under Sir <hi>John Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.</hi> p. 46.</note> It is recorded of Sir <hi>Anthony Wingfield,</hi> ſlain at <hi>Breſt</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> in the year 1594, That at his laſt going into <hi>Britain,</hi> he ſo diſpoſed of his Eſtate, as if he were never to return; and the ſame day, or day before his death, took ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his debts, as if he had a preſage of his end. Some have fore-told the day of their death: others have dropt ſuch paſſages at times, when no viſible ſigns of death then, as after have been better underſtood by their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Friends.</p>
                     <p>2. Theſe Death-ſallies reſpect the kind of death. The Lord takes ſome out of the world in way of Martyrdom, as <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7. 59. <hi>James, Acts</hi> 12. 2. Others dye a natural death, and that notwithſtanding all the attempts of men to the contrary. This was <hi>Luther</hi>'s caſe, who dies in his bed, do Emperor and Pope what they can to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>3. Theſe Death-fallies reſpect aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan then. The Devil is buſie then. I have always (ſaith a pious Divine) obſerved, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>John Barlow</hi> in his Ser. on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 24. pag. 50.</note> that when Satan moſt tempteth the truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, they ſeldom recover that ſickneſs: he hath great skill to diſcover how nature is weakned, and therefore taketh the fitteſt time for the purpoſe. It's reported of Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> how the Tempter aſſaulted him by way of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101303:142"/> ſyllogiſm on his death-bed, as was underſtood by <hi>Pemble</hi>'s denying ſometimes the Major, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-whiles the Minor-Propoſition. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, when the time of his Paſſion drew nigh, ſaid to his Apprehenders, <hi>This is your hour and power of darkneſs,</hi> Luke 22. 53. And what darts <hi>Satan</hi> ſhot at him in the bows of People, Soldiers, the Malefactor, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34, to 40. As the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be more than ordinary then, ſo are the ſallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in a way of aſſiſtance. It is ſaid in reference to Chriſt, when the bitter Cup was in his hand, there appeared an Angel from Heaven, ſtrengthning him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 43. The Lord helps his people in ſhooting this gulph. They will be out of gun-ſhot in a little time, and Death will be the death of temptations. The Sheep ſhall not be pluck't out of Chriſt's hand, though Satan catch at them, <hi>John</hi> 10. 28.</p>
                     <p>4. And laſtly, Theſe Death-ſallies reſpect Comforts at death, which are diſpenced after a more than ordinary ſort to ſome, as in <hi>Stephen</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55. The learned and pious <hi>Rivet</hi> in his laſt hours, ſeems to have had a turf of the Heavenly Inheritance, a firſt-ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſel of Heaven, a dawning of the joyful day of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And thus far of the Sallies of <hi>Providence</hi> in regard of Death, and other matters, as hath been inſiſted on. The Improvement of ſuch Sallies follows.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. OBSERVE and note well the Sallies of <hi>Providence.</hi> If Gold-filings are with care paper'd up, much more are the Wedges of Gold to be choicely laid up under Lock and Key. It is obſervable how there is a note of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or obſervation prefixt to the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Sallies of <hi>Providence,</hi> in the Sacred Scripture: ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 15. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 10. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 19.</p>
                     <p>2. Be thankful to God for what ſhare you have had in the ſignal Sallies of <hi>Providence</hi> on your behalf. Hath <hi>Providence</hi> ſtept in for thy help? holp up thy Cart when it was overturn'd, or ſuddenly ſuppli'd thee with a firm Wheel for a broken one? What remains now, but the celebrating the Name of God with <hi>Halelujahs?</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had their Song for that Sally at the Red-ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1. We read of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> when he had been ſick, and was recovered of his ſickneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> is affected with the Lord's deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out of the mouth of the Lion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
                     <p>3. Learn from the meditation of the Sallies of <hi>Providence,</hi> to truſt God both for thy ſelf and Relations. God's Saints have ſo done; their faith in running backward, hath fetch'd a leap forward. So <hi>David</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Abraham</hi> had an eye to the Sallies of <hi>Providence</hi> for his Son's marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 6, 7. he uſeth the means, ſends his ſervant on a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101303:143"/> Nuptial-Embaſſie, and ſo acquieſceth in God's <hi>Providence.</hi> The Sallies of <hi>Providence</hi> on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Children, are the beſt portion. They who can leave little or nothing to Children, yet if they leave them an intereſt in the Sallies of Divine <hi>Providence,</hi> do leave them enough; what is wanting one way, theſe Sallies of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> make up another way. Oh that Parents therefore would take leſs care, by taking more care; leſs care for the Earth, and more for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! The way to have things go well, is for Parents and Children to have God for their God, or to be reallly godly.

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>AS in the Temple of old there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places appropriated to perſons; ſo in the great Houſe of <hi>Providence:</hi> ſome are the Children, and have their lodgings; others Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Scavengers, who though they have ſome relation to the Houſe, yet are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe comparatively with others. There are three Courts or Circles in which men may be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>1. There is the large and outmoſt Circle of common or general <hi>Providence:</hi> Here all men, the worſt of men, even the Pagan-Pagans, may be placed. <hi>The Lord maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt,</hi> Mat. 5. 45. <hi>Nevertheleſs he left not himſelf without a witneſs, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Paganiſh people at <hi>Lyſtra, Acts</hi> 14. 17.</p>
                     <p>2. There is the intermediate Circle of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or limited <hi>Providence,</hi> which reſpects mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:101303:144"/> in common of the viſible Church. Unto the <hi>Jews</hi> were committed the Oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. they are called the children of the Kingdom, inaſmuch as God honoured them with his Worſhip and Ordinances, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
                     <p>3. There is the inmoſt Circle of peculiar and ſingular <hi>Providence.</hi> In this Circle are the Elect of God, and Called of him in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The former Circle is a viſible one; this inviſible: the former of larger circumference than this later; <hi>for many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> Mat. 22. 14. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe this by the notion of an houſe, in which are veſſels of divers ſorts, not only veſſels of gold and ſilver, but alſo of wood and of earth; ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                     <p>To what hath been ſaid of theſe different Courts, may be added what doth further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. where two things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable:</p>
                     <p>1. The different deſcriptions of parties there. The Gentile is ſet forth in his colours, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. the Jew or formal Profeſſor in his, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 28. the ſincere Saint in his, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29.</p>
                     <p>2. The different aggravation of ſin there. The Gentile's ſin is aggravated, in that he fights againſt the diſplays of a Deity in his Conſcience, which accuſeth him, <hi>v.</hi> 15. The <hi>Jew</hi> or Formaliſt hath his ſin aggravated, in that he oppugneth higher diſcoveries from Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23, 24. And conſequently, He who hath the higheſt Diſcoveries, hath
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101303:144"/> ſin in that reſpect aggravated the more, as in <hi>David</hi> his caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. QUARREL not with God, becauſe all are not within the inmoſt Circle of <hi>Providence.</hi> Corrupt Reaſon is ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its plea againſt God, as the Apoſtle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 19. But whatever the pleas of Reaſon are, yet they are without reaſon: for reaſon it is that the diſcoveries of God in Scripture ſhould be deciſive in matters. And here, to ſilence Cavils, there are Four things conſiderable:</p>
                     <p>1. Is there ground to diſpute with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for his not making all the Creatures of one or two ſpecifical Kinds? The Lord needed not direction from man in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeveral ſorts of creatures, according as they are brought forth on the Stage of the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. His Will and Wiſdom is to check man's Peeviſhneſs and Folly. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>hath made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> Prov. 16. 4. It is true, that the Lord hath not made the wicked as wicked, by way of poſitive effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; yet he hath conſulted with the glory of his Juſtice in the wicked's exiſtency, and that by way of antecedent permiſſion, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive antecedency. It is not from a defect of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101303:145"/> Power in God, as if Stones could not be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 9. The Lord's Will is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream reaſon why the Creatures are different both in regard of their natural and moral conſideration. No reaſon is there then for man to cavil at the difference there is (natural or moral) amongſt the Creatures.</p>
                     <p>2. Hath mortal man, without the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of cruelty, a liberty to appoint ſuch and ſuch young beaſts, ſome for the Plough, others for the Pail, and others for the Shambles? And ſhall it be deni'd to the Almighty, if he ſhall appoint, not all, but ſome, to obtain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt? 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 9. There is unqueſtionably a diſtance by Myriads of Myriads, between Man and an Infinite God. That diſtance between Man and the Beaſts, is but as the Tenth thouſand part of an Atom in compariſon of the whole World; yea, not that, in compariſon of the other diſtance between Man and the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> To quarrel then at the Lord's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is for a man to allow that in himſelf, which he will not on the other hand allow to his Maker and Soveraign Diſpoſer.</p>
                     <p>3. What if the Lord had wholly excluded men from his grace and favour; and inſtead of them, magnified his grace towards the lapſed Angels? Had he been unjuſt, cruel, partial therefore? No, no: and if ſo, then it follows, that he who might paſs by all the ſons of men without wrong done to them, is not to be cenſured becauſe he takes compaſſion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101303:145"/> only on ſome, and the reſt are hardned: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5, 7.</p>
                     <p>4. Men come not into the inmoſt Circle of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> becauſe they cannot, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not. A man is told, That if he travel on in ſuch a road, his throat will be cut, for there the Cut-throats are in ambuſh; if this man will on, his own perverſe will is in fault. A man is ſick, and this or that Remedy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and he will not make uſe of it; he dies of the diſeaſe, but the moral diſeaſe of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs may be rather termed the cauſe of his death. This is the Sinner's caſe. He is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd man for his own ways. <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? and the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners delight in their ſcorning? and fools hate knowledg?</hi> Prov. 1. 22. And, <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.</hi> To wave then diſputes about the Lord's Purpoſe; There is enough in man to apologize for God in regard of man's not being within the inmoſt Circle; for go to the Gentile who never heard of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſo by way of proportion make a judgment of the caſes of others, whoſe ears the joyful ſound of the Goſpel hath fill'd, but their hearts are empty of grace or goodneſs; and there will be no reaſon to multiply words without knowledg: for what ſaith the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles? Rom. 1. 21. <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned.</hi> We have here the judgment of the great Doctor of the Gentiles, who had taken cognizance of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101303:146"/> the matter: and his deciſion will the better appear, if a Comment, which a learned man hath on this Text, be alledged. <note place="margin">

                        <hi>The alledging of God's bountiful declaring of himſelf, in my Text</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>was to remove an objection which the Gentiles might urge in their own defence; it is not expreſly ſet down, but tacitly implied, in that it is refuted:</hi>

                        </gap>, becauſe, <hi>being a rational particle, and here uſed as inſtructive: ſo that whereas the Gentiles would perhaps have pleaded ignorance to excuſe their Idolatry; the Apoſtle ſhews them, that their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was</hi> craſſa &amp; affectata, <hi>groſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſuch as the Pope now a days enjoins his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and ſuch, as by the tenures of Philoſophy, doth augment rather than diminiſh an offence: for beſides that to excuſe ignorance, is required,</hi> Firſt, <hi>That it be not gotten by man's own fault, as theirs was in</hi> Adam<hi>'s tranſgreſſion.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That they bewail their own ignorance, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it, and deſire to be enlightned by the Spirit of God.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That God be obliged by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reſtore them to that light which they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully loſt: It is further exacted, That they make good uſe of that light of nature which is left them, and ſuffer it not groſly to be extinguiſhed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Look after a place then in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Circle of <hi>Providence.</hi> An intereſt in God, as reconciled in and through Jeſus Chriſt, is the Pearl of great price to be look't after. The Merchant in the Parable parts with all for the Pearl, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45, 46. As this Pearl is worth a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:101303:146"/> man's looking after, ſo a man ſhould not be diſcouraged from ſeeking it: for,</p>
                     <p>1. The Grace of God is extenſive to the Plough as well as Scepter: neither Prince nor Peaſant are excluded. That direction of <hi>Peter, Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. concerns men of all ranks; there is <hi>neither Greek nor Jew, circumciſion nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Chriſt is all and in all,</hi> Col. 3. 11.</p>
                     <p>2. What objection a perſon makes as a pull-back from looking after this Pearl, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of vileneſs and unworthineſs, may be anſwered, if conſideration be had how they who are in the inmoſt Circle of <hi>Providence,</hi> might have made the like objection, yea, had greater ſhew of diſcouragement. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan</hi> had a treble ſeeming repulſe, and yet is a prevailer. She who was called Dog, gathers up ſome crumbs of comfort under Chriſt's Table, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is a neceſſity of getting into this inmoſt Circle. Neither Civility, nor Common-gifts, will bring the ſoul to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without the new birth, and then without <hi>the inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reſerved in heaven,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. the ſounding braſs, and the tinckling cymbal, will make no muſick in the Heavenly Quire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. From the conſideration then of the danger of abiding in a ſtate of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy, reaſon as the Lepers in another caſe, <hi>Why ſit we here until we dye?</hi> 2 Kings 7. 3, 4.</p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:101303:147"/>
                     <p>If it be enquired here, What concerns per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in order to their getting into the inmoſt Circle of <hi>renewing</hi>-Providence? I anſwer in brief, negatively and poſitively.</p>
                     <p>1. Paſs not a falſe judgment about this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; diſtinguiſh betwixt Lamps, and Oyl in the Lamps, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3. Self-conceit and Deceit did undo the Phariſees, <hi>John</hi> 9. 49. Put not therefore Preſumption for Faith; a few of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Tears for Repentance; a Civil-life for ſound Reformation; Formality for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>2. Reſiſt not the motions of God's Spirit. This was the ſin of the Jews: <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Stephen</hi> to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. Many turn the deaf ear unto the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings of the Holy One. There is a ſtriving of the Spirit both immediately and mediately in the Miniſtry of the Word, with the ſpirits of men: ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. Oh take heed then of fighting againſt Heaven this way!</p>
                     <p>In the next place poſitively: and ſo,</p>
                     <p>1. Be inquiſitive after the way of ſalvation. <hi>Whither is thy beloved gone!

                     <p>3. Improve all awakening and rouzing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations of <hi>Providence.</hi> Some, if they are ſick, or otherwiſe afflicted, are for an Ekron-meſſage, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 2. they talk of Witches, but eye not God, nor have recourſe to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Suppoſe Satan be let looſe on them; yet there is a voice of God in the roaring of the Devil. An evil ſpirit in the daughter of the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is an occaſion of good both to Mother and Daughter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
                     <p>4. Follow Convictions with an eye had to God to period them in ſound Converſion. <hi>Paul</hi> was convinced of his ſins; and what is ſaid of him? <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> Acts 9. 11. <hi>Paul</hi> is now ſtriking on the Anvil whilſt the iron is hot. He ſoars aloft now at a Throne of Grace, and ſo avoids temptations. Larks, whilſt they ſing above in the air, are not in danger of the Fowler's Net. There are four Nets with which and in which the Devil labours to entangle perſons under convictions.</p>
                     <p>1. The Net of Worldly Cares. <hi>Cain</hi> builds houſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>The care of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches, choak the word,</hi> Mat. 13 22.</p>
                     <p>2. The Net of Carnal Fears. It is ſaid in the Parable of the ſeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. when tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended. <hi>Satan</hi> hath his art in ſcaring perſons from godlineſs, and that by ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the diſpleaſure of perſons, great ones, the multitude, and friends or near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He thus becomes a roaring Lion in the way.</p>
                     <p>3. The Net of Carnal Jollity. Some ſing,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101303:148"/> and drink, and play away the Convictions of Conſcience. <hi>Saul</hi> is for his Muſick, when Conſcience jarrs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
                     <p>4. The Net of vain Opinions. It's no new thing for perſons looking after God, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted by reaſon of tares ſown by ſome: ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. It hath been obſerved how the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries in <hi>Germany</hi> did dog at the heels the freſh reception of the Goſpel in places. <hi>Galeacius Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racciolus</hi> was in danger of ſeducers in his firſt looking after the ways of God. Let then thoſe who have eſcaped theſe Nets, and ſo recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the inmoſt Circle of Regenerating and Stabliſhing-Grace, be thankful to God; and let others, who have any of theſe Nets before them, look up to the God of all Grace for wiſdom to avoid them.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101303:149"/> paſſages referring to the members; but of ſuch which refer immediately to Chriſt the Head, and ſo to the Church; and which are the truth of this Obſervation. Two things may be noted here:</p>
                     <p>1. The previous Alteration at that time when Chriſt came. He was born in the days of <hi>Herod</hi> the King, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1. Who this <hi>Herod</hi> was, and how the Prophecy of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49. 12. was accompliſh't, is known to thoſe who liſt not to be contentious.</p>
                     <p>2. The great Tax impoſed by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> is another thing obſervable. This made way for Chriſt's birth at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that as foretold to be, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 2. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in this Tax pays Tribute to the King of Heaven, He brings ſtones to build God's Temple, whilſt he intends the raiſing of his Exchequer. His Political A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath its Eccleſiaſtical Aſpect.</p>
                     <p>3. From particular Demonſtrations: Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical motions have their references to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God divers ways:</p>
                     <p>1. By way of caſtigation for their ſins. When the children of the Kingdom wax wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, no wonder if ſome become Scourges for the afflicting of them. <hi>Moſes</hi> prophetically ſpeaks of this; <hi>But Jeſurun waxed fat, and kicked,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 32. 15. What follows then? ſee <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>I will heap miſchiefs; I will ſpend mine arrows upon them.</hi> And in <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>The ſword without, and terror within, ſhall deſtroy both the young man and the virgin, the ſuckling alſo, with the man of gray hairs. Moſes,</hi> who thus deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, was no falſe Prophet; the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                        <pb n="284" facs="tcp:101303:150"/> might find how a Prophet had been amongſt them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 6, 7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 14, 15, 16, 17. If we look into following Ages, we ſhall find, that the houſe hath been foul, ere the Lord of the houſe hath taken the Beſom in hand, and providentially delivered it into the hands of perſecuting ones. Thus <hi>Euſebius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates: <note place="margin">Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. 8. c. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>But after that our affairs through in much liberty, eaſe, and ſecurity, degenerated from the natural Rule of Piety, and after that one purſued another with open contumely and hatred, and when that we impugned our ſelves by no other than our ſelves, with the armour of ſpite, and ſharp ſpears of opprobrious words, ſo that biſhops againſt biſhops, and people againſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, raiſed ſedition,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then perſecution came on.</hi> It was wholſome advice therefore, which <hi>Bradford</hi> in the <hi>Marian</hi>-days gave to the City of <hi>London, Let the anger and plagues of God moſt juſtly fallen upon us, be applied to every one of our deſerts, that from the bottom of our hearts every one of us may ſay, It is I Lord that have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt thee; it is my hypocriſie, my vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, my covetouſneſs, uncleanneſs, carnality, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, idleneſs, unthankfulneſs, ſelf-love, and ſuch like, which have deſerved the taking away of our good King, of thy Word, and true Religion, of thy good Miniſters, by exile, priſonment, and death; it is my wickedneſs that cauſeth ſucceſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Authority and Peace to thine enemies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. By way of ſubverſion or vindictive pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for affronts and injuries offered to the people of God. God orders ſome to be Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to others who have been Scourges to his
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101303:150"/> people. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is the Sword of the Lord againſt <hi>Egypt, Ezek.</hi> 29. 18, 19, 20. and what <hi>Egypt</hi> was to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we have in <hi>v.</hi> 6. where it is ſaid, <hi>All the inhabitants of Egypt ſhall know that I am the Lord, becauſe they have been a ſtaff of reed to the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> The Kings of the earth are to hate the Whore, and to make her deſolate and naked, eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16. If it be asked, Why the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſo roughly to be handled? A reaſon there is <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi>) <hi>the woman drunken with the blood of the ſaints, and with the blood of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is obſerved how the <hi>Turks</hi> have fallen in on ſome places, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt themſelves of ſuch places, from whence the Proteſtants have been expelled by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi> Bloody Popery hath vengeance belonging to it. The more catholick and repeated are the inſolencies and cruelties of Papiſts, the greater ground of ſupport and comfort have godly Proteſtants, and that becauſe the Lord hath his time to make inquiſition for blood: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>3. By way of Diverſion. God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his <hi>Providence</hi> fill both the heads and hands of men full with work, and ſo they are not at leiſure to perſecute his people. <hi>Saul</hi> cannot follow his game in hunting <hi>David</hi> as a Partridg on the Mountains; there was another hunting-match provided, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Land, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 27. with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 20. Both ancient and modern Hiſtories do furniſh with exemplifications to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101303:151"/> 
                        <hi>Providence</hi> hath thrown in a bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and ſo there hath been a diverſion, and that without ſometimes of an utter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of perſons.</p>
                     <p>4. By way of Converſion of parties, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the truth in and by ſuch motions, ſtirrs, or alterations, as fall out in Kingdoms. The <hi>Romans</hi> had the <hi>Jews</hi> under their yoak, and that makes way for Chriſt's yoak to be put on the necks of ſome of the Soldiers; for the Soldiers demanded of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>And what ſhall we do?</hi> Luke 3. 14. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a Centurion of the band called the <hi>Italian</hi> band, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 1. In the Commotions of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers became Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpellers, as <hi>Lavater</hi> reports.<note place="margin">Ex <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, qui armis <hi>Germaniam</hi> religionis cauſa ſuperioribus annis vexarunt, non pauci ad fidem converſi, &amp; quidem Martyres Chriſti facti ſunt. In lib. <hi>Prov. Sol.</hi> Com. c. 16. v. 17.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. By way of purgation from ſin, and higher meaſures of ſanctification. God knows how to carry on his work, whilſt other kind of work is carri'd on by men. They who are good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better by the ſanctified evils of ſmart which befall them. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Jacob be purged: and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin,</hi> Iſa. 27. 9. The motions in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> State, and after in the <hi>Perſian,</hi> as they were the Lord's Hammer to knock down the <hi>Babylonians</hi> who held captive the Lord's people, had this tendency, namely, the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt ſin, and that becauſe the Lord had frowned on them in the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:101303:151"/> and ſmiled on them in the <hi>Perſian.</hi> So intimates <hi>Ezra,</hi> ſaying, <hi>And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſs, ſeeing that our God hath puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch deliverance as this: ſhould we again break thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? &amp;c.</hi> Ezra 9. 13. 14.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. TAKE notice of the care and love of God towards his people. God forgets not the good of his people in the motions and commotions that are in the World. Saints under their black clouds ſee not this, and are ready to ſay otherwiſe. <hi>But Zion ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me,</hi> Iſa. 49. 24. But what ſaith God, <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking-child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee,</hi> v. 25.</p>
                     <p>2. Learn how Divinity will ſee beyond State-Policy. A right view of matters taken as to the Church, is a prognoſtick, how things may probably go in the general as to the State. As there are different motions in the Affairs of State; ſo theſe different motions have their correſpondency with the different temper of a people profeſſing godlineſs. If hypocriſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſerious piety, and other ſins, ſpread as a Gangrene, no wonder if there are frowning-aſpects one way or other, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 6. If ſerious prayer to God, together with humiliation and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101303:152"/> reformation, are made conſcience of, then hopes there are, that he who hath torn will heal; and he who hath ſmitten, will bind up, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
                     <p>3. Give not way to inordinate fears, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs, and deſpondencies of heart, in the midſt of all the toſſings and tumblings of affairs of the world. Let perſons mind their duty, and let God alone to govern the world. There are theſe quieting conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>1. All the Affairs of the World are ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, who is the Head of the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. Now if Chriſt be thus the Head, he is not without eyes, he ſees, yea, foreſees what is to be done; and he is not without ſenſe; ſenſible he is what is done in way of affront to his Members. Whilſt <hi>Saul</hi> was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he ſaith, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Acts 9. 4. Suppoſe a man's head did reach up ſo high as the Heavens, he would feel the injury offered not only to a limb, but to the leaſt of his toes. Though Chriſt the Head, in regard of his bodily-preſence, be above the Clouds; yet he hath a ſenſe and feeling of what is done to the leaſt of his Saints.</p>
                     <p>2. The Chriſtian hath a very large Charter or Grant, of all things to work for good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28 The Church hath a very large Joynture; not only the pleaſant Vineyards, but the wild Copſes of the World, bring in a very rich Income to her. All is hers for good, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3. 22. and God thinks nothing too good for her. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Iſrael thy Saviour. I gave Egypt for thy ranſom,</hi>
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:101303:152"/> 
                        <hi>Ethiopia and Sheba for thee: ſince thou was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life,</hi> Iſa. 43. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>3. God hath made that which is a Saint's Priviledg (namely, an holy quietneſs of heart under the ſtirs of the World) to be a Saint's Duty, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 7. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord.</hi> Compare this with <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 9. <hi>But when ye ſhall hear of warrs and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be not terrified.</hi> And that in <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled: ye believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>2. From Exemplifications of ſuch, whoſe

That Wiſdom was ſteep'd in the blood of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;</hi> and that Court-Sophiſm had another kind of concluſion than intended. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> are multiplied, get out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> carry away wealth with them; and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prince, with the Chivalry of <hi>Egypt,</hi> periſh in the Red-ſea. <hi>Achitophel</hi> is a reputed Oracle for Policy; and yet his Policy, like a Musket, recoiling, beats him, with his earthly wiſdom, to the earth; ſo that it might be ſaid at his funeral, <hi>Earth to earth:</hi> he was firſt entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the working of violent affections; as Pride, in that his counſel was refuſed; and black fears, ſorrows, deſpondencies, in that, his counſel being refuſed, <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Deſign would miſcarry; And what would become then of the great Abettor of ſuch an horrid Deſign? No Clemency for himſelf, might be the Concluſion: and being thus entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the black thoughts of his heart, no wonder if he be further enſnared with an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is recorded 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 23. <hi>Herod</hi> plays the Politician; a fair Glove is drawn over a foul hand; <hi>Bring me word</hi> (ſaid he to the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) <hi>that I may come and worſhip him,</hi> Mat. 2. 7, 8. However he is defeated; for the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not ſuch fools as to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, being warned of God in a dream to the contrary. Neither hath <hi>Herod</hi> reaſon to ſtorm at the Wiſe-men: for if there were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the Promiſe was made to a Worſhipper,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:101303:154"/> not a Murderer; and no Contract of men muſt exclude the Lord, who is to have his negative voice; and this ſounded loud enough in the Wiſe-mens heads, though they were aſleep; for being warned of God in a dream, that they ſhould not return to <hi>Herod,</hi> they departed to their own Countrey another way.</p>
                     <p>3. From Demonſtrations; and that, (1.) In the general. (2.) In particular.</p>
                     <p>1. In the general. Whoſo ſhall place in the one Scale God's Wiſdom, and in the other the Quinteſſence, Extracts, Abridgments of men's deepeſt Policies, ſhall find all the Policies of men too leight to counterbalance Infinite Wiſdom. True is that of <hi>Solomon, There is no wiſdom, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21. 30.</p>
                     <p>2. In particular; let a view be taken, (1.) Of the Agents. (2) Of the Action, Medium, or Way, which is taken to accompliſh the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by men. As for the Agents, theſe are of two Orders: (1.) Principal or Primary. (2.) Miniſterial or under-Agents; and each of theſe fall, and that in another ſenſe too, under conſideration.</p>
                     <p>1. The principal or primary Agents have oftentimes <hi>Providence</hi> ſo counterworking them, as that there is a ſuſpenſion of action: what is propounded, is as it were thunder-ſtruck; and the Plot ſtumbles at the threſhold: and this comes to paſs divers ways:</p>
                     <p>1. By the interpoſition of ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who in regard of civil ſtation is amongſt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:101303:154"/> them; and ſo wiſely knocks in the head that Project, which otherwiſe might knock down ſome profeſſors of the truth. An inſtance for this, we have in <hi>John</hi> 7. An aſſembly there is of the chief Prieſts and Phariſees, <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> interpoſeth, ſaying, <hi>Doth our law judg any man before it hear him, and know what he doth,</hi> v. 51. Hereupon <hi>Nicodemus</hi> hath a check given, <hi>v.</hi> 52. and the Aſſembly is broken up; <hi>for every man went to his own houſe,</hi> v. 53.</p>
                     <p>2. By means of ſome calming-counſel dropt by one or other who is of the ſame fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the parties themſelves. Principles of Humanity and Ingenuity are not baniſh't from all; and theſe check bloody-concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which otherwiſe had been the birth of Debates and Conſultations. <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſtopt the Proceſs from coming forth againſt the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: However his advice were for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's eaſe, yet it was not conſonant to the conſtitution of the <hi>Jews</hi> Church; for a wild Toleration was no Slip in that encloſed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Whatever Principles <hi>Gamaliel</hi> did act from, I determine not; the iſſue of his ſpeech is recorded, for to him they agreed, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 40. It may be obſerved, how ſome of the Heathen have interceded for the Chriſtians, and ſo there hath been a ſtop more or leſs put to the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>3. By reaſon of a ſharp diviſion or conteſt amongſt the parties themſelves. Two men with a long beam carry it not a-thwart into the houſe; if they ſhall eſſay to carry it croſs over, they both ſit down as fools without
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101303:155"/> doors: Even ſo it is with the Adverſaries of Lord's people, they are not at an accord with themſelves. <hi>This man</hi> (as it was ſaid by ſome) <hi>is not of God, becauſe be keepeth not the ſabbath-day: others ſaid, How can a man that is a ſinner, do ſuch miracles? and there was a diviſion amongſt them,</hi> Joh. 9. 16. So a bone of contention is thrown amongſt the Phariſees and Sadduces: <hi>There aroſe a diſſention between the Phariſees and Sadduces: and the multitude was divided,</hi> Acts 23. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>4. By means of men's own fears. Some would be more miſchievous; but they fear where the wind may ſit. <hi>Herod</hi> holds his hands from ſlaying the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> for a while; fear cramps them, when he would have been doing; <hi>he feared the multitude, becauſe they counted him as a prophet,</hi> Mat. 14. 5. The chief Prieſts and Phariſees ſtorm at Chriſt's Sermon: <hi>but when they ſought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, becauſe they took him for a prophet,</hi> Mat. 21. 45, 46.</p>
                     <p>5. By reaſon of ſome diverſion, their hands being full of other work. The Child is going to ſchool, and by the way a dog grins, and is ready to fall on the Child; another Dog hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to come by, and together the Dogs are by the ears, and ſo the Child paſſeth by unhurt. That inſtance of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> invading the land, by means whereof <hi>Saul</hi> was diverted from the purſuit of <hi>David,</hi> is full proof, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 27, 28. The Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> had a Writ of Eaſe, and that by reaſon of the <hi>Turks</hi> finding work for the Emperor.</p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:101303:155"/>
                     <p>6. By the death's of perſons. Here the action falls to ground with the perſon. Death is the death of men's Projects and Deſigns. <hi>In that very day his thoughts periſh,</hi> Pſal. 146. 4. The Angel tells <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They are dead which ſought the child's life,</hi> Mat. 2. 20.</p>
                     <p>7. By means of ſome other courſe which <hi>Providence</hi> takes, when it doth not take away the chief Agents by death. Thus when God works a wonderful change on perſons, whether by the infuſion of grace, or ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conviction. The Heathen-fury had a ſtop put to it, by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> becoming Chriſtian. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s frowns are turned into ſmiles on <hi>Shadrack, Meſech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> Dan. 3. And thus for Agents principal, how in regard of them the Deſign falls to the ground.</p>
                     <p>2. Agents Miniſterial, or under-Agents, which are as hands employed to miſchief; others become handleſs, and that divers ways too.</p>
                     <p>1. By the poſition or implantation of grace in the hearts of ſuch. He who becomes a man of other Principles, is a man of other Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He ſees enough of his former courſe of life, and ſo will not do as formerly. <hi>Paul</hi> lets fall his Commiſſion againſt the Diſciples at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> and ſo the Mountain-expectations of the High-Prieſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> vaniſh into nothing; yea, become ſomething by way of vexation, whenas the Perſecutor turns Preacher, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>2. By ſome conviction upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though it end not in converſion. God
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:101303:156"/> hath more ways than one in ſpeaking to the hearts of men. The hearts and hands of men may fail to do their work, and yet a ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of grace is not done upon the heart: ſo probably in <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 45, 46. <hi>Then came the Officers to the chief Prieſts and Phariſees, and they ſaid to them, Why have ye not brought him? the Officers anſwered, Never man ſpake like this man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. By ſome external baffling <hi>Providence,</hi> which puts by the Deſign intended. The King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſent to <hi>Dothan</hi> Horſes, and Chariots, and a great Hoſt, and all this is done to ſeiſe on <hi>Eliſha;</hi> and yet their work is not done: for they came on a blind meſſage; as the ſtory at large is recorded, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>4. By drawing forth the affection of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as founded on ſome relation to them, or kindneſs received from them. <hi>Saul</hi> was poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in the beſtowing his Daughter on <hi>David,</hi> that the might be a ſnare unto him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 21. But this device of his takes not; for ſhe deceives the Deceiver: Her love to <hi>David</hi> is ſeen when the Meſſengers of death were ſent for him, and ſhe then becomes <hi>David</hi>'s Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, as in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. By the deaths of ſuch who are employed. They who envy others their lives, may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe their own. <hi>Providence</hi> can ſoon provide graves for thoſe whoſe throats are open ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers againſt God's ſervants. That ſurly Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with his Fifty, and the ſecond with his, did experience this: their words were ſtout againſt the Prophet; <hi>Thou man of God, the King hath ſaid, Come down,</hi> ſaith the firſt. <hi>O</hi>
                        <pb n="297" facs="tcp:101303:156"/> 
                        <hi>man of God, thus hath the King ſaid, Come down quickly,</hi> ſaid the other; and inſtead of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's coming down, fire came down, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them and their Fifties. Had they been of another ſpirit with the third Captain ſent, they might have had better ſucceſs in their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, as the other had: ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>6. By ſome extraordinary diſplay of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> where death doth not intercept the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Agent. <hi>Balaam</hi> is ſent for to curſe <hi>Iſrael:</hi> He brake not his neck by the way: We read how the Aſſe cruſh't his foot againſt the wall, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 25. on he goes, but the work is not done; a miraculous over-ruling hand of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is ſeen, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 10. <hi>And Balak's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was kindled againſt Balaam, and he ſmote his hands together; and Balak ſaid unto Balaam, I called thee to curſe mine enemies, and behold thou haſt altogether bleſſed them theſe three times.</hi> And thus for the Agents miniſterial, or under-Agents, how they become vain in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts or ſervice in which they are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                     <p>2. In the next place, The Action, Way, or Means, in order to the End, is to be ſpoken to: And this may be conſidered divers ways.</p>
                     <p>1. As abſurd, and improper to bring about the End. The Action is like that of the men, who are ſaid to make an hedg to keep in the Owl; and to ſeek for a River to drown the Eel in. Men's unruly paſſions are in-lets of folly: a miſt is rais'd by theſe, and ſo they ſee not their way. There is a judicial infatuation to be obſerved. No wonder if they have a ſoft
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101303:157"/> place in their heads, who have a hard one in their hearts. <hi>The wiſe man's eyes are in his head: but the fool walketh in darkneſs,</hi> Eccleſ. 2. 14. <hi>Surely the Princes of Zoan are fools; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the wiſe counſellors is become brutiſh—</hi> Iſa. 19. 11.</p>
                     <p>2. If the Way or Means pitch'd on to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve the End, be unhappily adequate, apt, or fit, in a ſort, to bring about the End in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; then a diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> there is, in that the Means are not cloſed with. A two-edged Sword, ſharp enough to make a fatal divorce between the head and ſhoulders, is laid forth on the Council-board; but it appears to be but a Woodden-dagger, and ſo it is not made uſe of. Thus the good <note place="margin">Certè ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ut ea conſilia, quae aſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta erant, <hi>Abſolomo</hi> fatua vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derentur. <hi>Pet.

                     </p>
                     <p>3. Though the Means be liked, yet all is daſh't by ſome diſcovery made, and that by means extraordinary or ordinary. The King of <hi>Syria</hi> his deſign where he would have his Camp, is diſcovered by the Prophet to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſaved himſelf thence not once, nor twice, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 9, 10. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the chief of the Fathers ſmell a deſign of the Adverſaries of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:101303:157"/> when they ſaid, <hi>Let us build with you,</hi> Ezra 4. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> perceived that God had not ſent <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> but that <hi>Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Samballat</hi> had hired him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 12, 13. Black deſigns are unmasked by <hi>Providence:</hi> So the Powder-plot in King <hi>James</hi> his days: Let the Man at <hi>Rome</hi> canonize the Under-agents for Saints; the Canon of Scripture will evidence them to be Sinners: They may be reputed good ſons of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> amongſt Papiſts; but ſhall paſs for Saltpeter-men, amongſt good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Proteſtants.</p>
                     <p>4. Suppoſe the Means fail not by reaſon of diſcovery; yet it is marr'd in the mode or manner of uſing. Men make more haſte than good ſpeed. <hi>The counſel of the froward is carried head-long,</hi> Job 5. 3. Now men's counſels (ſaith a good Interpreter) are carried head-long, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Caryll.</hi>
                        </note> when they go too faſt forward, and make ſo much haſte on in their way, that they tire, and are out of breath, or ſtumble, or break themſelves, before they can attain their journey's-end.</p>
                     <p>5. If men miſcarry not with their Deſign in the manner of managing it; yet they hit not the ſeaſon for effecting it. Whether the man trot or gallop on Horſe-back to ſpeak with another, it matters not, if that be the day when the man is from his home. <hi>Saul</hi>'s Meſſengers come with their Net to catch <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> but the Bird was fled, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 12, 14.</p>
                     <p>6. If there be a ſeaſonable application of Means, according to human apprehenſion; yet the End is not attained, by reaſon of ſome
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:101303:158"/> check given at the very nick of time. <hi>Man knoweth not that which ſhall be: for who can tell him when it ſhall be?</hi> Ezek. 8. 7. <hi>Caeſar Borgias,</hi> who thought <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Caeſar Borgias</hi> mihi dixit, ſe ad omnem rerum even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quem à patris morte futurum putaret, longè in poſterum proſpexiſſe, at<expan>

Machiav.</hi> Prin. c. 7.</note> how to manage all to his own intereſt on his Father's death, little thought of his own ſickneſs at that very time, whereby all his other politick proviſion made, did avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It's worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, how there is a check given at the nick of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded application of Means, and that ſometimes by ſome ſingle emergency of one thing or other; and ſometimes by a throng of contingents and occurrencies. God will be known to be ſupream; man points, and the Lord diſappoints. <hi>Providence</hi> hath many ways to overturn the Politicians Cart. Little doth the Driver imagine what may happen by the way, notwithſtanding he may pretend great skill in driving: an Aſſe with her long ears, or ſome other object, may fright his Team of Horſes, and all the tackling is rent to pieces; yea, it may be, a Cart-wheel goes over our Politick Drivers, and what then becomes of all Political Skill, or Skilful Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy?</p>
                     <p>7. Suppoſe the application of Means are not thus check't; yet how is all over-ruled, and hath another iſſue than was meerly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The Bowl hits the Jack, yet lies at ſuch: diſtance from it, that it wins not the Caſt.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:101303:158"/> Here we conſider the iſſue of the application of the Means, two ways: (1.) In reſpect of Saints. (2.) In reſpect of Sinners: or, The Deſigned, and the Deſigners.</p>
                     <p>1. In reſpect of the Deſigned, or thoſe who are made at by wicked ones. The worſt that wicked men can do, is ordered for the beſt.

There was a Court-Project to caſt <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Den of Lions; the King was circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that buſineſs: no help for a <hi>Daniel,</hi> but from God: the Plot which took, was broken by its ſucceſs.

Suppoſe the Plot of theſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, as for the utmoſt end of it, the ruin of <hi>Daniel,</hi> had taken? yet <hi>Daniel</hi> had been no loſer to dye for his God; they had (no thank to their pride, envy, murder), been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the promoting of <hi>Daniel</hi> in an higher Court than that of <hi>Darius; For bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they which dye in the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, yea ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them,</hi> Rev. 14. 13.</p>
                     <p>2. In reſpect of the Deſigners; and ſo what they have done, is a foundation for checking what they after attempt to do another way.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:101303:159"/> As it is ſaid of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> that he had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured his body to counter-poyſons to prevent poyſon, that when he would poyſon himſelf, then it was the more difficult to effect it. And as it happens to the Carpenter, he wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles an hole, and a piece of the Wimble is left behind, which obſtructs the pin, ſo that it hath not firm footing: Some who are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Jeſuits, and intended to be Inſtruments to check the progreſs of the Goſpel; after may become ſturdy reſiſtants of Jeſuitical Deſigns, another way being taken to obſtruct the Goſpel. And thus the Hedg of Thorns may become (through an over-ruling <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>) a good fence to the bed of Roſes. God is wiſe, who makes the earth, even that which brings forth briers and thorns, to help his people; to allude to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 16.</p>
                     <p>Again, What men after do, lays foundation for confuſion and vexation, in reference to what they have done.

A Saint ſhall do more by his plain prayer to God, than a Sinner by his intricate policy ſhall do againſt a Child of God. <hi>O Lord, I pray thee</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi>) <hi>turn the counſel of Achitophel into fooliſhneſs,</hi> 2 Sam. 17. 31. <hi>David</hi> by a ſhort and pathetical petition to God, prays a wiſe <note place="margin">Multos <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitopheles</hi> hodie Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus habet ſecum, quod intelligimus ex illis quae aſtutè agit; abundat Papatus copiis &amp; Principum armis, ſed aſtuta conſili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:101303:160"/>
                     <p>2. There is a notable deſcription of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting-<hi>Providence</hi> in regard of the devices of men againſt the Church. <hi>He that ſitteth in the heavens, ſhall laugh: the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion,</hi> Pſal. 2. 4. This laughter here, after the manner of men, is attributed to God. It may point at three things:</p>
                     <p>1. Sedateneſs or Tranquillity. God is not affected in the leaſt, by way of perturbation, with the devices and politick contrivances of men. An Army of expert Soldiers is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to behold a company of Children making towards them with Reeds in their hands. They therefore who have compoſed ſpirits, when wicked ones are buſie in their Cobweb-work, do the more reſemble Him who ſits in the Heavens, and thus laughs.</p>
                     <p>2. Ability, or Facility to daſh their deſigns. A wiſe man who laughs at the project of an Adverſary, ſeeth the vanity of the project: He needeth not enter into a deep contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how to counterwork ſo ſhallow an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>3. Perſpicacity, or inſight into the caſe of the Snarers ſnared by the very courſe they take. A wiſe man, who ſees in ſome meaſure the end of buſineſs at the beginning of it, well may laugh when the Adverſary ſhall make a rod for his own back. The Lord gives ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners line, and ſo they are entangled to their own ſorrow. Thus he that ſitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens laughs: no reaſon for them who have the Lord of Heaven for theirs, to weep, unleſs it be for ſinning againſt their Lord.</p>

                     <p>THE truth of this appears: (1.) From God's threatning and puniſhing of men for ſuch matters, the doing whereof (though not the ſo doing in regard of the Agents) had its warrant from the Lord. <hi>Jehu</hi> was the Sithe-man of <hi>Providence</hi> to mow down the Houſe of <hi>Ahab: Thou</hi> (ſaid the Prophet to him) <hi>ſhalt ſmite the houſe of Ahab,</hi> 2 Kings 9. 7. <hi>Jehu</hi> hath a bloody-commiſſion, yet righteous in regard of God, but ſinfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by <hi>Jehu,</hi> whoſe end was ſelfiſh; and therefore the Lord threatens, ſaying, <hi>I wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. From Exemplifications: and that, (1.) In Civils: Men have their Aims, Ends; the Lord hath his. <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeks the loſt living goods of his Father; and in ſeeking, is brought to <hi>Samuel,</hi> according as God had before ſpoken to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſaying, <hi>To morrow about this time I wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In Sacreds, God hath his end, and men have theirs: the Action is one and the ſame, the End different. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in Chriſt's name, and yet are rejected at the great day.

                     <p>Again, Exemplifications there are of this, wherein we may behold the work of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> carried on ſometimes more immediately, ſometimes more remotely: There is work ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged at firſt-hand, and at ſecond and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.

                     <p>1. OBSERVE hence, how men act freely, without compulſion, and yet infallibly, as the work to be done holds correſpondence with the purpoſe of God, whether ſecret, or declared. We may ſay truly in this caſe, as the High-Prieſt in another, <hi>What further need have we of witneſſes?</hi> Mat. 26. 65. behold their own confeſſions and acknowledgments do witneſs their ſpontaneous actings.

                     <p>2. Deſpond not, how this or that ſhall be brought about, which ſhall make for God's glory, and his diſtreſſed people's good. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> can find tools enough in the world to do the work of <hi>Providence.</hi> Many a man works

It may be obſerved how men's intereſts are ſo interwoven, as that they ſhall do that, or forward that, which otherwiſe would not be done. In <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth's days (Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi>) the caſe of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants was very low; the grave was made; there only ſeemed nothing elſe but the tolling the Bell for the Funerals: <hi>Maurice</hi> on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, like a great Bell, is raiſed, and the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering-noiſe hereof frights <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth out of <hi>Germany.</hi>

To ſeek God's glory in God's way, is for men to conſult their own honour.

                           <item>2. As preventive of Evils.</item>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Delays are doors, or in-lets to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: <hi>Joab</hi> cautions <hi>David</hi> againſt a Delay. <hi>Now therefore ariſe, go forth and ſpeak comfortably unto thy ſervants: for I ſwear by the Lord, If thou go not forth, there will not tarry with thee one this night; and that will be worſe unto thee than all the evil that befel thee from thy youth until now,</hi> 2 Sam 19. 7. The Delay of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> is the occaſion of his being be-nighted, and ſo he ſtops at <hi>Gibeah;</hi> where what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is recorded. That long chain of Evils, of burning luſts, cutting up the Concubine in pieces, the deaths of many thouſands in the Warr, hath a Delay for the firſt link thereof, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 8. We find in Hiſtory, how the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Mauricius</hi> delaying to execute the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Phocas,</hi> by reaſon of the Feſtival-ſeaſon of the Nativity of Chriſt, <hi>Phocas</hi> eſcapes in that interval of time, becomes the bloody Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

                     <p>2. Delays are ſometimes preventive of Evil. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is caſt into the pit; the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſate down to eat and to drink; the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> draw nigh to them, and ſo the Lamb is not butchered; he is ſold, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a rich Leeſe in the Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> Gen. 37. 23, 24, 25, 26.

                     <p>1. Be well acquainted with thy conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or temper; wiſely ſuſpect it, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly moderate it.

O how much is there of a glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of <hi>Providence</hi> both in Haſtes and Delays! The Church of God doth experiment this: The wind of <hi>Providence</hi> blows good to the Lord's people, and that though at different points of the Compaſs. Sometimes they who are Pirates, and ſeek to make a prey of God's people, are wind-bound: and ſometimes a fair wind they have, but the guſt are ſo ſtrong and vehement, as that the Ship of Fools is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.

                     <p>IN <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. every one of the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had four faces, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and the wheels there, or rather the rings of them, as the more immediate ſubject, are ſaid to be full of eyes, <hi>v.</hi> 18. What may theſe paſſages in the viſion import, but probably the manifold aſpect of <hi>Providence</hi> in matters? However, the truth of the Obſervation may be conſidered two ways:</p>
                     <p>1. Exemplifications there are in Scripture to this purpoſe. That <hi>Providence</hi> in the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's going down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> had its various aſpects: it did look backward on their guilt, for that is brought to remembrance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. and it did look forward to their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the time of Famine, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> doth inform them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 7. The borrowing of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Treaſure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 31, 36. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in a way of puniſhment, in the Lord's transferring the property of the goods borrowed, to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:101303:168"/> are now well paid for their hard ſervice, and are furniſh't with materials for the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſuch as gold, ſilver, braſs, blue, purple, and ſcarlet, Onyx-ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exod. 25. The taking of the Ark by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 11. ſeems to confute a conceit of God's protecting Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, becauſe of the outward ſymbol or ſign of his preſence in which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> reſted, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and not only ſo, but to puniſh the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their Ark-remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſins or provocations, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth that <hi>Providence</hi> ſtop here, God vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates the honour of the Ark thus taken; the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> ſhall be overcom'd; when they do overcome: The Ark of God amongſt them, that Sacred Cheſt, becomes in a ſort a large Coffin for the burial of many of them: for there was a deadly deſtruction thorowout all their Cities; the hand of God was heavy on them, as is recorded 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 6, 9, 11. The ſlaying of <hi>Saul</hi> by the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> reſpects not only <hi>Saul</hi>'s puniſhment for his ſins, but the exaltation of <hi>David,</hi> according to God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, on which the <hi>Providence</hi> caſt an aſpect in order to its gradual fulfilling: for now <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> goes up to <hi>Hebron.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 1. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1, 2. the Wiſe-men came from the Eaſt: that journey of theirs did reſpect their own good, the alarumning of the <hi>Jews</hi> to conſider of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s being born; the confirmation of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> their faith in Chriſt. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24. Chriſt was aſleep in the Ship: This ſleep, as it was demonſtrative of his Human Nature, and probably an effect of wearineſs a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:101303:168"/> ſinleſs infirmity, ſee <hi>John</hi> 4. 6. So alſo did it ſerve for the trial of the Diſciples, as <hi>v.</hi> 25. In <hi>v.</hi> 28. of the ſame Chapter, we read of two poſſeſſed with Devils. That <hi>Providence</hi> in the poſſeſſion there, had its manifold aſpects: the various ends for which it might ſerve, may in brief be indigitated; as, (1.) To puniſh and chaſten for ſin the poſſeſſed, and others afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the poſſeſſed; for it is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>they were exceeding fierce, ſo that no men might paſs that way.</hi> (2.) To exerciſe the Diſciples: for no ſooner are they eſcaped the ſea-ſtorm, but a land-one waits for them: before there were fears of drowning; now an occaſion for fears leſt they ſhould be torn in pieces by the poſſeſſed with devils. (3.) To illuſtrate the power and goodneſs of Chriſt, who frees the houſe of evil tenants, and putteth reaſon, if not grace too, into poſſeſſion; ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 35. (4.) To make way for the puniſhment of the Hoggiſh-<hi>Gergeſenes,</hi> whoſe Swine were dearer to them than the Lamb of God, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 34. And thus for Exemplifications: more might be inſtanced in; but theſe may ſuffice, and that the rather, ſeeing others will be couch'd in what follows.</p>
                     <p>2. There are diſtributions, diſtinctions, or conſiderations of the Aſpects of <hi>Providence.</hi> Theſe may be diverſified or branched divers ways.</p>
                     <p>1. The Aſpect of <hi>Providence</hi> ſometimes looks upward after a more ſignal ſort, and not ſo downward on the party, the ſubject of the Diſpenſation. So in the man who was
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:101303:169"/> blind from his birth: <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſay the Diſciples), <hi>who did ſin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jeſus anſwered, Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him,</hi> John. 9. 1, 2, 3. Had there been no ſin in the World, there had been no blindneſs. The blindneſs of this man was an afflictive evil both to the man and his Parents: It cannot then be denied, <note place="margin">Natus eſt ita<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>

                        </note> as if <hi>Providence</hi> did overlook ſin, and the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Son and Parents abſolutely: its aſpect there is downward in a ſenſe, but more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally another way, <hi>viz.</hi> That by Chriſt in the blind man the work of God might be declared, as one noteth.</p>
                     <p>2. The face of <hi>Providence</hi> looks on others as well as the parties who are the immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it. And this, (1.) By way of caution or warning to take heed of ſin, for which ſuch and ſuch have been the ſubjects of ſmart. They in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s time are willed to note the <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh-Providence: But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 7. 12. <hi>Remember Lot's Wife,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 32. (2.) By way of imitation, in regard of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of grace. <hi>Job</hi>'s trials may leſſon others, who have little of <hi>Job</hi>'s afflictions, and leſs of his patience under them. God did ſet him up as a ſtately Monument for the diſplay of grace to the ages to come, <hi>James</hi> 5. 11. (3.) By way of particular encouragement to look up to God, and wait on him for help, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the intervention of ſpecial <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:101303:169"/> which though in the firſt place it cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in, or falls on one; yet reacheth another's caſe. A clear inſtance for this, we have in <hi>Mark</hi> 5. where <hi>Jairus</hi> beſought Chriſt for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the point of death, <hi>v.</hi> 23. By the way a ſtop is made; an intervening-Providence there is in the cure of the woman which had an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of blood twelve years, <hi>v.</hi> 25, to 34. Now this <hi>Providence</hi> in the cure of the woman, may ſerve for the cure of <hi>Jairus</hi> his faith; it might encourage him who met with ſuch an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging-diſpenſation. Chriſt ſaith to him, <hi>Be not afraid, only believe, v.</hi> 36. Chriſt here, like the Husbandman, neglects not the Vine, whilſt he goes aſide a little to ſeek for a prop for its ſupport.</p>
                     <p>3. The Aſpect of <hi>Providence</hi> is ſometimes frowning, but after a different ſort. There is the wrinckled brow of Diſpleaſure, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as it reſpects ſlaves and children in the family. The ſame <hi>Providence</hi> which hath ſharp teeth for ſinners, hath its filed or blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones for Saints. So in that overflowing-ſcourge <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. Some ſhall be trodden down by it; a wo there is to the mockers there, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 18, to 23. Others they have ground and direction for ſupport; and they might eye Chriſt who was to come, and ſo conclude there would not be an utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mpation of the Nation, and for his ſake there would be mitigation; ſee <hi>v.</hi> 16. yea, that though they who were the good corn, met with the wheel; yet it is not a breaking-wheel, as is there allegorically intimated, <hi>v.</hi> 28. ſee
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:101303:170"/> ſomewhat a parallel-place, which may ſerve both for a proof of what is here intended, and a comment or expoſition on this of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>4. The face of Providence looks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on what is paſt, preſent, and to come. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s expulſion from the Royal Seat, looks back on the Prophetical Viſion as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 4. 25. It ſtares <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> in the face; looks big on him, when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is ſwollen big with pride: <hi>For while the word</hi> (a proud one) <hi>was in the King's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. V. 31. <hi>The ſame hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men,</hi> &amp;c. v. 33. And this his being driven from men, looks forward, inaſmuch as the proud fleſh being eaten out by this Corroſive, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again to his Power and Dignity, <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35, 36, 37. <hi>Jonah</hi> is thrown over-board into the ſea, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 15. Here, by this <hi>Providence,</hi> as the Mariners are leſſoned to know more of the God of the Winds and Sea; ſo <hi>Jonah</hi> is catechized by the rough Meſſenger which purſued him: <hi>The ſea wrought, and was tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous,</hi> v. 11. The points of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Catechiſm were two: What an Evil he had committed, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and, What good the Lord intended by making him ductile and pliable to go to <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> and preach unto them the preaching that God bid him, as it is ſaid <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                     <p>5. The Aſpect of <hi>Providence</hi> may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as primary and ſecondary. There is a primary or chief Errand which <hi>Providence</hi> hath
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:101303:170"/> to a man under this or that Diſpenſation; as he who goes to a Prince's Court, intends prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the ſight of the Prince, and yet beholds others there. Sometimes an afflictive Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be primarily, by way of caſtigation for ſome ſpecial ſin; and ſecondarily, by way of probation, trial, or exerciſe of grace. Thus in <hi>David</hi>'s caſe, when <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s wild and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid pranks are the Remembrancers of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s folly in the matter of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. Again, otherwhiles a Diſpenſation of <hi>Providence</hi> may principally reſpect the trial of grace, and not ſome ſignal guilt foregoing. So in <hi>Job</hi> his caſe, <hi>Providence</hi> might caſt there an eye on the ſins of his youth, as that paſſage <hi>Job</hi> 13. 26, may import; and yet it might primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and point out the ſparkling-graces of his riper years: for we read of <hi>Job</hi>'s precious pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and rare or admired circumſpection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devil was let looſe on him; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Lord's approbation of him: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth Satan charge againſt <hi>Job,</hi> but a falſly ſuppoſed guilt of ſelfiſhneſs in ſerving God, ſee <hi>Job</hi> 1. Theſe and the like Reaſons may ſway, That though correction for ſin is not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet the diſplay of grace was primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that ſtartling Diſpenſation of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>

                     <p>1. VVHAT ſtupidity, dulneſs, and inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, is abroad in the World! <hi>Providence,</hi> like the Sun, ſcatters its beams, and and few they are who ſee them. The moſt of perſons, if they ſee any thing, it's like that man in <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24. <hi>I ſee men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like trees walking.</hi> It's often to be noted, how men have general and confuſed apprehenſions of a frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſpect of <hi>Providence;</hi> It is for our ſins, ſay they, that this or that judgment is: Here is a ſtop; they are not by a frowning-<hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> frown'd into an holy loathing of ſuch ſins which <hi>Providence</hi> frowns on. The Aſpects of <hi>Providence</hi> are little ſeen, and leſs improved. <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Iſa. 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>2. Take heed of ſlandering <hi>Providence</hi> in its Aſpects. Make not that an encouraging-Aſpect of <hi>Providence,</hi> which God doth not ſo make, conſtitute, or appoint. There is a Negative-Aſpect of <hi>Providence,</hi> where man ſometimes fancies a Poſitive-one. He that ſhall follow the falſe Prophet becauſe of a ſign given, and that ſign comes to paſs, abuſeth <hi>Providence</hi> in a pretended Aſpect of it; ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>3. Labour to be verſt in the Aſpects of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> For want of an holy dexterity this way, a man wrongs God, others, and himſelf: He faſtens, by a wrong conſtruction, that on God, which the Lord approveth not; and is injurious to others and himſelf, as others or
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101303:171"/> himſelf are concern'd in the wrong Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drawn from the Aſpects of <hi>Providence.</hi> Here ſome Directions might be inſiſted on; I ſhall touch on a few.</p>
                     <p>1. Take heed of an erroneous judgment. <hi>If the light that is in a man, be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> Mat. 6. 23. The <hi>Jews,</hi> who took themſelves to be in the right, and withal judged Chriſt to be a Deceiver, how do they miſapply the Aſpect of <hi>Providence</hi> towards Chriſt on the Croſs? It's true, the Aſpect was a frowning one; but not in ſuch ſort as they blaſphemouſly aſſerted it to be, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. The two Witneſſes are ſlain; and what befalls them, is otherwiſe, than according to truth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by them who did rejoyce over them, and make merry, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>Luther,</hi> whilſt a zealous <hi>Papiſt,</hi> had other thoughts of the <note place="margin">Inter hos autem oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currebant &amp; iſti fratres, quos <hi>Pighardos</hi> vocabant, jam mihi non ita inviſi, ut anteà erant in Papiſtate meâ.</note> Diſſentients from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Synagogue, than afterwards when his judgment was ſet right, as he declareth in his Preface to the Confeſſion of Faith of the Barons and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Conſider how a benign Aſpect may be a frowning one; and a frowning one, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable one. The proſperity of a ſinner, is his miſery; and the adverſity of a Saint, is his mercy, as the Lord ordereth the matter in the courſe of his <hi>Providence.</hi> Want of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſee a myſtery in God's <hi>Providence</hi> on
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101303:172"/> this wiſe, is the reaſon why men are out in their apprehenſions about the Aſpects of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks fully to this, ſaying, <hi>O Lord, how great are thy works, and thy thoughts are very deep! a brutiſh man knoweth not, neither doth a fool underſtand this: when the wicked ſpring as the graſs, and when all the workers of iniquity do flouriſh; it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 92. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>3. Be not too quick or haſty in paſſing a judgment on an Aſpect of <hi>Providence.</hi> The Wind of <hi>Providence</hi> is up, but how ſoon, and where, or in what quarter it may ſet, man knoweth not. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> cenſure <hi>Paul</hi> for a Murderer, becauſe Vengeance in its frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſpect purſues him; but when <hi>Paul</hi> ſhook off the Beaſt into the fire, and felt no harm, they changed their minds, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>4. Remember how the Aſpects of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> have a different conſideration. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Providence</hi> reſpects the Perſon, but not the Action. So in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his Wife, which was like to be defiled in <hi>Abimilech</hi>'s Court. God had a reſpect to <hi>Abraham</hi> as he was <hi>Abraham</hi> the Saint, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Prophet, not <hi>Abraham</hi> the diſtruſter of <hi>Providence</hi> in that matter. The Aſpect of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> doth not countenance <hi>Abraham</hi>'s miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in that buſineſs: <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſpoken of there as a Prophet, not a Diſſembler, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20 7.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Providence</hi> may reſpect the ſubſtance of the action, buſineſs, management, not the circumſtances, or irregularity coupled with
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:101303:172"/> the intention, diſpoſition, endeavour to do this or that. It is ſaid, God dealt well with the Midwifes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 20. Suppoſe they had told a lye, yet God dealt not well with them becauſe they lied; but becauſe they were merciful to the people of God, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerveth, or becauſe they feared God, as it is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 21. Whatever were their ſlips, it ſeems they did act from a vertuous principle, which God graciouſly taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and recompenceth, as is ſaid in the verſe mentioned. <hi>Lot</hi> hath a ſhare in a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Providence,</hi> by way of reſcue or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the hands of rude neighbours, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 9, 10, 11. He had made a fair, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a foul, propoſal of Articles for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, <hi>v</hi> 8. <hi>Providence</hi> doth not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that proffer of his; it muſt not be conſtrued ſo, but as it it reſpects <hi>Lot</hi> a Saint, or his pious diſpoſition and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve his Gueſts: <hi>Providence</hi> keeps him, who was willing to have the Laws of Hoſpitality kept unviolated, as he profeſſeth, ſaying, <hi>Only unto theſe men do nothing; for therefore came they under the ſhadow of my roof,</hi> ver. 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly, Providence</hi> reſpects neither Perſon nor Action; but ſomething elſe which is the primary object of its aſpect. <hi>Joaſh</hi> is only ſav'd alive, when all the Seed-Royal is deſtroyed by <hi>Athaliah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 10, 11, 12. He prov'd bad enough afterward, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo ſignal preſervation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:101303:173"/> to the Throne: God's <hi>Providence</hi> in the preſerving of him, and exalting him, did not ſo much reſpect him, unleſs to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his ſin; as the promiſe made to <hi>David,</hi> whoſe line was not quite to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh't; for ſo it is intimated in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Behold the kings ſon ſhall reign, as the Lord hath ſaid of the ſons of David. Iſmael</hi> is a great man; and whence is this? The Prayer of a good Father, and the Promiſe of the great God, are the ſtilts on which <hi>Iſmael</hi>'s Greatneſs mounteth aloft, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 20.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>AS there are prefix't Paſſages or Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to what the Lord commendeth to man's conſideration in the Sacred Scripture, as, <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, thus ſaith the Lord: whoſo hath ears to hear, let him hear:</hi> So there are Prefaces to God's Providential Diſpenſations. Before, in the Aſpects of <hi>Providence,</hi> it was touch't how ſome did look forward to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; theſe Aſpects, which may be termed Proemial, or Precurſory, are like Scouts of the Army, or the Forlorn-hope, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage firſt, ere the body of the Army come up to grapple with the Enemy. Now that there are Providential paſſages of this nature, appears,</p>
                     <p>1. From Increpations or Reproofs for not heeding them. So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>Strangers have devoured his ſtrength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth it not.</hi> And ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. Chriſt checks
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:101303:174"/> the <hi>Jews,</hi> in that they could obſerve a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going work of <hi>Providence</hi> in Naturals, but not ſo in Spirituals: <hi>When it is evening</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ſay it will be fair weather, for the skie is red; and in the morning, it will be foul weather, for the skie is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites! ye can diſcern the face of the skie, but ye cannot diſcern the ſigns of the times,</hi> v. 2, 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> did not ſo take notice of Prophecies refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Chriſt; The Scepter's departing from <hi>Judah;</hi> The coming of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> that Goſpel-<hi>Elijah;</hi> The Miracles of Chriſt done amongſt them: All which, not ſo heeded, might be proemial ſigns too, of approaching judgment. They, it ſeems, were better verſt in their Almanacks, than in their Bibles, and the accommodation of what is in their Bibles to their preſent condition; and for this their ſtupidity, they are check't by Chriſt, and that ſharply too.</p>
                     <p>2. From Admonitions or Exhortations to take notice of ſuch Prefaces of <hi>Providence</hi> to matters. There is a Treatiſe of antecedent ſigns pen'd by a Divine-hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. Thoſe percurſory ſigns ſpoken of there, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with reſpect to the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the World. An Admonition to conſider of the one, we have in <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>When ye therefore ſhall ſee the abomination of deſolation ſpoken of by Daniel the prophet; whoſo readeth, let him underſtand,</hi> &amp;c. An exhortation to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the other, yet not excluding the former ſort of approaching ſigns of calamity, we have in <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>Now learn a parable of the fig-tree,</hi>
                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:101303:174"/> 
                        <hi>when his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that ſummer is nigh: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye, when ye ſhall ſee all theſe things, know it is near, even at the door.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. From Exemplifications of ſuch Prefaces of <hi>Providence,</hi> and that as they have a reference (1) To perſons good; and (2.) bad.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt ſort. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſlays the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſmiting an <hi>Hebrew, Exod.</hi> 2. 21. This fact of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to be a preſage of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as one who would be the Hammer of <hi>Providence</hi> to knock down the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as he afterwards proved. Before <hi>Moſes, Joſeph</hi> had that in a dream which was afterwards fulfilled, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c. Sampſon</hi> rent the young Lion as one would have rent a Kid, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14. 5, 6. He afterwards makes renting-work amongſt the <hi>Philiſtins. David</hi> ſlays the Lion and the Bear; and after that, a Metaphorical Lion or Bear, namely, <hi>Goliah</hi> the <hi>Philiſtin,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. Theſe Acts were preambulatory to noble and royal Acts of Valour performed by him afterwards. Our Saviour in his minority is found ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them queſtions; and all that heard him, were aſtoniſhed at his underſtanding and anſwers, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 46, 47.</p>
                     <p>Again, There are ſome Prefaces of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> which reſpect the Bad, whom <hi>Providence</hi> may uſe for black work to be done in the world. It is ſaid, <hi>Sarah ſaw the ſon of Agar the Egyptian, which ſhe had born unto Abraham, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Gen. 21. 9. Here is an early diſcovery of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> whoſe poſterity were cruel mockers
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:101303:175"/> indeed, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 6. they were of that Juncto there ſpoken of; and did perſiſt on in the old antipathy of their father, who, born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was to be a ſcourge to the houſe of <hi>David:</hi> He was an active man, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> takes cogniſance of, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 28. His new Garment is rent into twelve pieces, and ten of them are delivered him by the Prophet, <hi>Ahijah,</hi> and that as a preſage of the ten Tribes to be headed by him, <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſought to kill <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> but <hi>Jeroboam</hi> eſcapes into <hi>Egypt,</hi> there he lurks till the ſeed of Sedition is up, and towards its harveſt, as <hi>v.</hi> 40, with the next Chapter compar'd. <hi>Judas</hi> betrays his Maſter; beſides a typical preſage of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 9. with <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 16. there were ſome other preſages, which after his horrid treachery, might be better underſtood by the Diſciples. That in <hi>John</hi> 6. 70. <hi>Have not I</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</hi> was a tinckling of the Larum-bell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Diſciples. Whether <hi>Judas</hi> did then ſpet ſome of his venom, yet more ſecretly, amongſt the Diſciples which there went back, and walked no more with Chriſt; and ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, or helpt to hold open, the door of their apoſtacy: or whether, upon their apoſtacy, he begun to make a ſtir amongſt the eleven, and ſo was a Mutineer in that ſmall company left, is not ſo expreſt in the Chapter; yet whether the one or the other, or both, may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as the occaſion of Chriſt's ſpeech, may not peremptorily be denied. We find how
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101303:175"/> the ſame <hi>Judas</hi> was a Make-bate, a Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> at another time, <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>Why was not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</hi> v. 5. <hi>This he ſaid</hi> (ſaith the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 6.) <hi>not that he cared for the poor, but becauſe he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. Judas</hi> his heart was as full of covetous projects, as the bag of treaſure which he bare. His heart was betray'd by this World's goods, ere he betrays his Lord and Maſter. The Devil knows how to hew an Hypocrite, a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, a Murderer, out of the Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. A worldly heart will be any thing than what it ſhould be. The prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks or preſages of Apoſtacy, may be ſeen in an inordinacy of affection to the things of this life. So in <hi>Judas</hi> here, that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is known by his griping-paw.</p>
                     <p>4. From the Diſtinctions of Proemial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations, or Preſages of <hi>Providence.</hi> Theſe may be conſidered,
<list>
                           <item>1. In reſpect of the Mode or Manner, how they are by way of Preſage.</item>
                           <item>2. In reſpect of the Matter, to which they have reference.</item>
                           <item>3. In regard of the Subjects or Perſons concern'd in them.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the firſt place then, Preſages are conſidered, (1.) By way of meer ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and that, (1.) Negatively, as to that which ſhall not be. So the Bow in the Cloud
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:101303:176"/> is a ſignificant Pledg or Token that the waters ſhall no more become a flood to deſtroy all fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 13, 14, 15. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 5, 6, 7. with 11, 14, 15. (2.) Poſitively, as to that which thus or thus falls out. So the ſhooting of the Arrow by <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> and the ſmiting upon the ground with the Arrows, were a preſage, though an extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted one, of the ſmiting of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 17, 18, 19. The crowing of the Cock was a preſage of what Chriſt had ſaid to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 26. 34. with 74, 75.</p>
                     <p>2. By way of real Cauſality; And ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s noble Exploits had an influence to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received as King by the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who came to him, ſaying, <hi>Behold, we are thy bone, and thy fleſh: alſo in time paſt, when Saul was king over us, thou waſt he that leddeſt out, and broughteſt in Iſrael: and the Lord ſaid to thee, Thou ſhalt feed my people Iſrael, and thou ſhalt be captain over Iſrael: ſo all the elders of Iſrael came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron, before the Lord; and they anointed David king over Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 5. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>3. By way of ſignificancy and cauſality. There are Preſages mix't. <hi>Gideon</hi> goes to the <hi>Midianites</hi> Tents, hears one of the Soldiers telling his dream to his fellow; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the interpretation thereof given by his fellow: and hereupon <hi>Gideon</hi> is quickned to ſaith, prayer, and courage to ſet on the Army of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> who are worſted, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. 10, &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:101303:176"/>
                     <p>Hither may be referred Comets, or Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing-Starrs as vulgarly termed: which as they have often an experienced ſignificancy, ſo ſome cauſal influence: for (as is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſome) the matter of theſe being hot and dry exhalations, no wonder if there follows, (1.) Barrenneſs of the Earth, and ſo the fruits thereof more or leſs ſail. (2.) The reduction of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in men's bodies to an hot and dry intemperature. (3.) From this intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the Humours, what can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but an epidemical ſpreading of acute Diſeaſes. (4.) From the hot and dry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature both of Bodies and the Air, the Minds of men, which have a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with the Body, are eaſily provoked to wrath, contentions, brawls, and fights: and whereas Kings and Princes are more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or tender than others, and naturally more elated, and have the Humours more accommodated and eaſie for inflammation, than others, it may eaſily happen, that in theſe hot and dry years, than at other times, Princes are ſooner and more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently ſtirred up to Contentions, Revenges, and the waging of Warr in the World; and theſe Warrs oftentimes bring with them the changes of Government or Kingdoms. Thus the learned <hi>Zanchy.</hi> All I have to ſay here, is: None of the Works of God are to be ſlighted: and though there be ſome foundation in Second Cauſes, yet we are

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Preſages of <hi>Providence</hi> may be conſidered in reſpect of the Matter to which they have a reference. And ſo they are, (1.)

So the death of <hi>Abijah,</hi> the taking away of him from evil to come, was a ſad preſage of wrath to come on <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>'s Family, as is declared at large in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. The falling of <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark, was a fore-runner of the falling of the Lord's heavy hand on the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 5. Other Exemplifications for both theſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Preſages Joyous and Doleful, are couch't in the fore-going Inſtances, though not alledged under the notion of this particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but under the notion of Preſages in the general.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Preſages may be conſidered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Subjects or Perſons concerned; and ſo perſons may be conſidered,</p>
                     <p>1. Singly, or in regard of private capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as they reſpect a perſon, or particular family, relating to the head of the family.

                     <p>2. Conjunctively, or as they reſpect a Community of perſons, a people, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Preſages are, may be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of joy or wo. There are National Mercies, and National Judgments, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to or of each. The diſtinct handling of each ſort of Preſages, will fall in with Mercies and Afflictions, which are not here particularly to be inſiſted on. I paſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Accommodation or Improvement of the Obſervation.</p>

                     <p>1. LEARN from whence ſome do give a notable gueſs at future matters. A due obſervance of foregoing Diſpenſations, is a key to unlock the door for an inſight into future ones. As ſome creatures are more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of an approaching ſtorm; they are the Husbandman's natural Almanack, and trueſt one too, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 31. So they who obſerve
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:101303:178"/> the out-goings of God in the world, may ſee further than the Politicians of the world. Great ones, who cannot ſee day at a little hole, are ſtrangely be-nighted in their deſigns and undertakings.</p>
                     <p>2. Obſerve <hi>Providence</hi> by way of preſage; and that the rather, conſidering, (1.) That ſo God's Saints have done. As we are not to make preſages where no ground is ſo to do; ſo we are not to paſs by that, the obſervance whereof may be conſiſtent with wiſdom. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> put not off <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s dreams, becauſe dreams, and the dreams of a boy; he gives him the hearing, and obſerves ſomething more in them than the workings of a childiſh fancy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 11. (2.) The not heeding of <hi>Providence</hi> in its Proemial diſplays or preſages, may in ſome caſes prove to be of dangerous conſequence. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was the <hi>Elias</hi> to come, he was the fore-runner of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> for ſo ſaid he, <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 1. v. 17. <hi>He ſhall go before him in the ſpirit and power of Elias.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> did not heed the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in the <hi>Baptiſt, Mat.</hi> 17. 12. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatſoever they liſted. Likewiſe ſhall alſo the Son of Man ſuffer of them.</hi> Thus the King's Harbinger being not regarded, no wonder if the King himſelf be not welcom'd. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not,</hi> John 1. 11.</p>

                     <p>THIS <hi>Obſervation</hi> being akin to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the leſs may be ſaid: yet if the more be ſaid, each of theſe, like two Glaſſes, may reflect on each other; and things reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, will the better be taken cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of. Before, we conſidered <hi>Providence</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an eye looking forward; here we may look on it as an hand, throwing up the earth, and laying in ſtones for ſuperſtruction-work to go on. There are three Generals to be ſpoken to here:
<list>
                           <item>1. The various Mode or Manner how paſt or preſent paſſages of <hi>Providence</hi> lay a foundation.</item>
                           <item>2. The interval of time between the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and after-Superſtruction.</item>
                           <item>3. The Latitude or Extent of this with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Matters.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:101303:179"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To begin then with the firſt; and ſo paſt and preſent things, in order to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, may be conſidered,</p>
                     <p>1. According to their intrinſecal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, their uſual manner of working, qualification for what is the ordinary reſult, as <hi>Providence</hi> is converſant about them. Thus it is ſaid, that <hi>the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain,</hi> 1 King. 18. 44. And ſo <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Surely oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad, and a gift deſtroyeth the heart:</hi> that is, impatiency and vexation of mind (as one ſaith) <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cartwright</hi> in locum.</note> is a kind of madneſs, which oppreſſion with its force and nature bringeth, unleſs a man well principled with piety, flie unto God for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and refuge; and after the like ſort, <hi>bribery blinds the eyes of a wiſe man—</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, things may be conſidered according to a ſupernatural cauſality attending them in regard of their iſſues: and here the ſaid things may be conſidered (as over-ruled by <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>) three ways:</p>
                     <p>1. As indifferent in their own nature for the production of this or that effect. The Ax cuts the wood, and cuts a man's leg: the ſame Ax which fells the tree down for fewel or ſome other uſe, kills a man at another time, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 5.</p>
                     <p>2. As having ſome tendency, inclination, or propenſity, for this or that effect; but not proportionable, in it ſelf conſidered, for the product thereof. <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Three hundred men rout a vaſt Army, and ſo lay a foundation for their Countrey's quier, and reſpit from the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> fury, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:101303:179"/>
                     <p>3. As averſe and contrariant in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to what follows. Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren rid their Father's houſe of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> which act of theirs, by an over-ruling <hi>Providence,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes for the preſervation of the Family af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, as is aſſerted by <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 45. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>There is another conſideration of things paſt and preſent, in order to futurity; and that is,</p>
                     <p>1. By way of natural cauſality; as things according to their very natures phyſically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, work thus, as for fire to burn the houſes of <hi>Ziglag,</hi> being applied to them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 3.</p>
                     <p>2. By way of moral cauſality or order which the Lord hath ſet. Thus the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> did prophane the Lord's Supper: and this lays a moral foundation for a future Houſe of Correction to be erected amongſt them: <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 30. On the other hand, when the Temple work was minded by them in the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi>'s time, the laying of the foundation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was through grace the laying of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of future Mercies; as is plainly declared in <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>3. By way both of natural and moral cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality. Both theſe ſtreams meet in one channel ſometimes. <hi>The drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty: and drowſineſs ſhall clothe a man with rags,</hi> Prov. 23. 21. Theſe ſins have not only a moral provocation in them, by reaſon
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:101303:180"/> whereof God doth righteouſly puniſh the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but likewiſe according to a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, are an in-let to poverty. Drunkenneſs (as one ſaith) turns man, his family, yea his houſe too, out at the Wicket. Some ſins are coſtly, and are Moths to men's Eſtates. Men do not only fight againſt God with their Mercies, but alſo againſt their own Eſtates, Peace, and Comfort. They take the link-ſtock, fire the Cannons, and have no ground to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with <hi>Providence,</hi> if the Chain-ſhot, or Wedg heated red-hot in the fire of their luſts, light on their own houſes, to the burning of them. And thus for the firſt general propounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The interval or ſpace of time betwixt Cauſes, Effects, and Conſequents, comes next to be inſiſted on. And here, as there is a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-grain; and Spring-ſeed, as Oats, Barley, which are earthed after the former: ſo ſome things come to paſs after, which were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Cauſes before. There is a Treaſure-houſe of <hi>Providence;</hi> Mercies and Judgments are laid up in this Treaſure-houſe. The open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Treaſure-houſe belongs to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He times the opening of it.</p>
                     <p>1. Sometimes there is but a little diſtance between the iſſues of Matters, and their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Houſe is ſoon up, and covered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be an Houſe of Feaſting, or Mourning. A word, and good word, there is for <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> with the people, when they are faſting and praying upon the account of that great Multitude which came againſt them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>To morrow go out againſt them, for the Lord</hi>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:101303:180"/> 
                        <hi>will be with you. Elijah</hi> ſends word to <hi>Ahab</hi> after a long drought, ſaying, <hi>Prepare thy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and get thee down, that the rain ſtop thee not: and it came to paſs, that in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds,</hi> &amp;c. 1 King. 18. 44, 45. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow; thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. 27. 1.</p>
                     <p>2. Otherwhile the diſtance is wider; Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Effects do not ſhake hands by and by. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren made a Rod for their backs, which hung up by the wall of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> for ſome years, ere they were laſh't by in it <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s being ſent into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> had a reference to the future good of his Father's Family. The Tree was tranſplanted long before <hi>Jacob,</hi> with his ſons, eat of the fruit thereof: for <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſeventeen years when ſold into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 37. 2. and he was thirty years old, when he ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 41 16. and he tells his brethren, after they find him Lord-Treaſurer in <hi>Egypt,</hi> how that two years hath the Famine been in the land, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 6. yea, moreover, <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s going down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> laid foundation for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> going up out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> according to the prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The latitude or extent of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for future matters, is next to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto; and may be conſidered two ways:
<list>
                           <item>1. In reſpect of Things.</item>
                           <item>2. In reſpect more immediately of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:101303:181"/>
                     <p>1. In reſpect of things: and ſo there is a large harveſt of Temporals and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als from ſeed before ſown. Not to be large here, ſeeing Inſtances which may ſerve have been mentioned materially, and may eaſily here formally be inſiſted on. Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> is the man ſent before, when the Lord called for a Famine upon the Land, and brake the whole ſtaff of bread, as is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 16, 17. Wiſe-men from the Eaſt bring gifts, Gold, Frankincenſe, and Myrrhe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 11. This their Preſent is of great uſe for the Egypt-Journey at hand: for <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> being low in the world, are now the better provided-for in a ſtrange Countrey. The Eye of <hi>Providence</hi> fore-ſees future Exigencies; and the Hand of <hi>Providence</hi> is ſometimes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand by way of proviſion for the children of <hi>Providence.</hi> Other things might here be inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, as in Marriage, Health, Liberty: but I paſs to things of ſpiritual concernment; and ſo to avoid repetition of what elſewhere is here reducible, I ſhall only touch on two things: (1.) Converſion to the Faith. (2.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the Faith. There are paſſages of <hi>Providence</hi> which pave a way to each. God in his <hi>Providence</hi> raiſeth up Inſtruments, whom he ſends and bleſſeth in their Miniſtry, ſo that <hi>faith comes by hearing,</hi> as the Apoſtle doth declare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15, 17. Words ſpoken at one time, lay a foundation for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at another: So <hi>John</hi> 2. 22. <hi>When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this unto them;</hi>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:101303:181"/> 
                        <hi>and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jeſus had ſaid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. In reſpect of Perſons: And here we may take a view of the All-wiſe-founding-Providence, as it reſpects perſons Political and Eccleſiaſtical; or Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in God's holy Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>1. There are paſſages which refer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under a Political conſideration: and theſe may be diſtinguiſh't, (1.) As they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the advancement, promotion, exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons to places of Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. (2.) As they reſpect the dejection of perſons, the clipping their Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. That there are matters which may lay ſome foundation more or leſs both as to the one and the other, is apparent out of the Hiſtory (to go no further) of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> What theſe matters in particular are, is ſubject-matter for a Treatiſe of <hi>Providence</hi> referring to Politicals.</p>
                     <p>2. There are paſſages of <hi>Providence</hi> which reſpect Eccleſiaſtical perſons; whom God takes near to himſelf in his ſervice, as was ſaid of the Tribe of <hi>Levi, Numb.</hi> 3. 6. Theſe may be diſtinguiſh't into ſuch which are,
<list>
                           <item>1. More remote.</item>
                           <item>2. More near.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>To inſtance in the firſt, God's preſerving of them in the foregoing part of their life, is obſervable. <hi>Muſculus,</hi> when a little one, had the Plague: he dies not, God having work for him to do: he is plague-proof, till the work be done. <hi>Moſes</hi> the Lord's Prophet
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101303:182"/> in the Old-Teſtament, Chriſt in the New, are exemplifications of this. Neither <hi>Pharoah</hi> the bloody Wolf, nor <hi>Herod</hi> the old Fox, choak theſe Lambs in their Infancy, as hath elſewhere been noted upon another Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>Again, there are paſſages of <hi>Providence</hi> more near; as preparation or fitting for the work, and actual calling and diſpoſing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God in his <hi>Providence</hi> ſeeth beſt <hi>Timothy</hi> was nurtured in the knowledg of the Scriptures from a Child, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 15. To be well verſt in the Scriptures, is a good preparative for Divinity. He is after ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſet apart for publick work of the Miniſtry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. The Diſciples of Chriſt were Hearers of Him, before they were Speakers. They had an extraordinary Call as Apoſtles; and this their receiving the Lord's Preſs-mony, had a reſpect to future Service.</p>
                     <p>More might be ſaid here, as it refers to Perſons Eccleſiaſtical, who as they are Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Church, ſo may they be ſpoken of in a Treatiſe of <hi>Providence</hi> referring to God's Church or People.</p>

It's our wiſdom then to obſerve the diſplay of God's Attributes, in bringing water from this and that Spring-head, by many windings, over many Hills, and through divers Vales; and that to refreſh ſome, and drown others: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 4. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 7.</p>

                     <p>THAT the comparing of ſome ſingle act or acts of <hi>Providence,</hi> with an after-act or acts of <hi>Providence</hi> about matters, is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Caſement for light to come in on the underſtanding, doth appear as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>1. Some have been ſtartled, ſtaggered, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſt, diſquieted, whilſt they have been held at a gaze of ſome act or acts of <hi>Providence</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters; but, on the other hand, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, compoſed, ſatisfied, when they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a view of the whole of a Diſpenſation. <hi>Jacob</hi> upon the ſuppoſed loſs of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> talks of nothing but his grave, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 35. but when he ſaw the Waggons which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſent to carry him, his ſpirit revived; he ſaid, <hi>It is enough, Joſeph my ſon is yet alive; I will go and ſee him before I dye,</hi> Gen. 45. 27, 28. What an eye-fore was the proſperity of the wicked,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:101303:184"/> ſolely conſidered, to the <hi>Pſalmiſt? But as for me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well-nigh ſlipt, when I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked,</hi> Pſal. 73. 2, 3. And in <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins:</hi> But after, theſe pangs of diſquiet have an end, when he can ſay, <hi>Then I underſtood their end; ſurely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places; thou caſtedſt them down into deſtruction,</hi> v. 17, 18. The two Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> were nigh ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſorrow and diſquiet, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rid them off their legs of Faith; and that while they caſt back an eye on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> where their Lord and Maſter was lately crucified: <hi>We truſted</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael</hi> Luke 24. 21. but after, they are taught a leſſon to conſider that Golgotha-Diſpenſation as a copulative one, v. 26. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> They might have been ſtumbled, if the Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha-Diſpenſation had not been: for how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhould Chriſt have riſen from the grave, triumphed over enemies, fulfilled the Scripture, according as he intimates, <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>2. The taking a view of the whole of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in matters, doth after a natural ſort contribute to the better underſtanding of matters. He that comes into an Artificer's or Joyner's Shop, and ſees here and there ſome pieces for a Box, or into a Taylor's Shop, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>holds here a Skirt, there a Sleeve; may at preſent, through his want of thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, be at a loſs what to make of theſe
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:101303:184"/> ſomethings-nothings: but after, when all is ſet together, there is a proof of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's skill, and a confutation of the man's ignorance, who knew not what belongs to the Box or Garment. Even thus it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Providential-Diſpenſations. Or as the Types of old are better underſtood when conſidered in conjunction with what is typed forth by them, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 9. with <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. ſo this or that act of <hi>Providence</hi> may better be apprehended after, than at preſent. So Chriſt tells <hi>Peter, What I do, thou knoweſt not now: but thou ſhalt know hereafter,</hi> John 13. 7.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. SEE one way to prevent guilt of ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſpenſations of God, whether they reſpect our ſelves or others; and that is by a copulative or conjunctive conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Providence</hi> as to matters. Had <hi>Jonah</hi> waited a while, he need not have been ſo pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and froward upon the account of the blaſting of his Guord. <hi>Then ſaid the Lord, Thou haſt had pity on the guord for which thou haſt not laboured, neither madeſt it to grow; which came up in a night, and periſhed in a night: and ſhould not I ſpare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than ſix-ſcore thouſand perſons, that cannot</hi>
                        <pb n="354" facs="tcp:101303:185"/> 
                        <hi>diſcern between their right hand and their left, and alſo much cuttel,</hi> Jonah 4. 10, 11. The <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> likewiſe acknowledgeth his fault, which the non-conſideration of <hi>Providence</hi> conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, was an in-let or door to, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant: I was as a beaſt before thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Look after a ſweet waiting-frame of heart under this and that Diſpenſation of <hi>Providence. Yea, in the way of thy judgments have we waited for thee, O Lord,</hi> Iſa. 26. 8. <hi>I will ſtand upon my watch, and ſet me upon the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay to me, and what I ſhall anſwer when I am repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> (or, <hi>when I am argued with,</hi> as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin hath it) <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 1. Could perſons be ſo compoſed when they firſt ſet foot on the borders of a Diſpenſation, as they are, or ought to be, when they have footed it through to the other end; they would foot it cheerfully without faintneſs and ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by the way. We ſhould then in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence poſſeſs our ſelves, till the Lord's work be over. Copulative <hi>Providence</hi> is the Silver Trumpet of God's Praiſes. <hi>Joſeph</hi> beholds a glorious diſplay of the Divine Attributes in God's Diſpenſation towards him. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him as brought into the great Hall of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hung with Cloath of Arras; at firſt entry, he ſees a Leg or Arm of a man in the Hangings, but after, when he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to walk up and down there, he ſees a beautiful piece of Workmanſhip: Even ſo,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:101303:185"/> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> looks not to the violent hand of his Brethren in the Hangings of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> but conſiders all together, he ſees the curious Artifice of <hi>Providence</hi> in all, and ſo tells his Brethren; <hi>But as for you, ye thought evil againſt me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to paſs as it is this day, to ſave much people alive,</hi> Gen. 50. 20. <hi>Job,</hi> who hath his Scene, and that a ſad one too, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth all for good in the end. So <hi>James</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</hi>

                     <p>THOUGH <hi>Providence</hi> ſeem to ſound Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; yet it hath its Correſpondencies or ſweet Accords; and that, with

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is an Harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> with the Purpoſe or Decree of God. <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world,</hi> Acts 15. 18. The proceſs of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> in the ſixth Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is according to the Book of the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſpoken of in the fifth Chapter and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verſe. I enlarge not here, having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken diſtinctly and largely to this in a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Obſervation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an Harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> with the Sacred Scriptures. It is ſaid, <hi>Amos</hi> 3 3. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> The Scripture and <hi>Providence</hi> do walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they are agreed in the journey's end,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:101303:186"/> where to meet; albeit one of them may ſeem to leave the company of the other for ſome miles. <hi>Providence,</hi> in regard of its correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the word, may be termed a viſible Bible, or a Commentary on it. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved how <hi>Providence</hi> paſſeth not by this or that as inconſiderable in the word. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34. there is mention made of the Cormorant, Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, Owl, Raven, Vultures, and all theſe as ſymptoms or tokens of deſolation, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Now obſerve what follows in <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Seek ye out the book of the Lord, and read: no one of theſe ſhall fail; none ſhall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his Spirit it hath gathered them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now more particularly, The Word may be conſidered,</p>
                     <p>1. By way of prediction, or fore-telling matters ſo ſtrictly or pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ciſely.</p>
                     <p>2. By way of poſitive aſſertion; there are ſuch and ſuch propoſitions in which this and that are predicated of the ſubject; as inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces frequently do occur in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> referring to the righteous and the wicked.</p>
                     <p>3. By way of Commination or Threatning.</p>
                     <p>4. By way of Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>According to all theſe Conſiderations <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> doth harmonize. Let the Word, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fore-mentioned ways, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a-right, and <hi>Providence</hi> will not be found a-wrong. The Word and <hi>Providence</hi> are like two ſticks in the water, which ſeem crooked by reaſon of the <hi>Medium,</hi> or the waters in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101303:187"/> and yet neither of them are really ſo. There is a miſapprehenſion on man's part too often, both in reference to the Word, and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> Theſe do accord: witneſs thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the word, <hi>That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken,</hi> Ezra 1. 1. <hi>That he might perform his ſaying which the Lord ſpake,</hi> 1 King. 12. 15. and the like. There muſt needs indeed be an accord between the Word and <hi>Providence,</hi> ſeeing Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power, Wiſdom, Truth, Juſtice, do make up the match. God will not be wanting in his <hi>Providence</hi> to maintain the reputation of his Word: yea, the harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> is ſometimes ſo audible, that a <hi>Pagan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> ear can diſcern it. <hi>The Captain of the guard took Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, and ſaid unto him, The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place: now the Lord hath brought it, and done according as he hath ſaid,</hi> Jer. 40. 2, 3. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 24, 25.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is an Harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> with the Prayers of Saints. So 1 Joh. 5. 14. <hi>And this is the confidence that we have in him, That if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> There are many Exemplifications for this both in the Old and New Teſtament. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may after be made of Exemplifications, and likewiſe ſomewhat be ſpoken concerning the anſwer to prayers, in a diſtinct following Obſervation. Here it may ſuffice, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of <hi>Providence</hi> with Prayer, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh't,</p>
                     <p>1. Into a Negative one, and yet without a contradiction. Foundation for this, we have in <hi>Amos</hi> 7. the Prophet there hath a Viſion of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:101303:187"/> Graſhoppers; and hereupon he prays, <hi>O Lord forgive, I beſeech thee; by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe! for he is ſmall.</hi> The reply to this prayer we have <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>The Lord repented for this: it ſhall not be, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. There is a poſitive accord of <hi>Providence</hi> with Prayer; not only what ſhall not be, but what ſhall be, hath its accord with Prayer. <hi>Elias prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three years and ſix months: and he prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit,</hi> Jam. 5. 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is an Harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> with it ſelf. <hi>Providence,</hi> for the main, is the ſame in all Ages. A man's head and face are ſtill the ſame, though his hair be cut, and his beard be ſhaven, and his apparel or garb different. There is a ſubſtantial Harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> with <hi>Providence.</hi> If the Harmony be not a literal one, or for kind the ſame; yet there is an Harmony in regard of the general nature, as it is either frowning or ſmiling. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, To what end are the Diſpenſations of God in former Ages commended to the ſerious meditation of others in after-ages? <hi>Now theſe things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>were our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to the intent, we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted: neither be ye idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as were ſome of them; as it is written, The people ſate down to eat, and to drink, and roſe up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as ſome of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thouſand. Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as</hi>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:101303:188"/> 
                        <hi>ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of ſerpents. Neither murmur ye, as ſome of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer. Now all theſe things happened unto them for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples; and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, here let it be weighed, how <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential</hi> Diſpenſations are ſtreams iſſuing from the Word; whether conſidered as unwritten before <hi>Moſes</hi> his days, or written as after. Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Diſpenſations, and frowning ones, are the births of Promiſes and Threatnings. If then the Word of God be Heaven's ſtanding-rule for man's uſe, and that as it hath both Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Threats annexed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. the <hi>Providence</hi> of God then muſt have its ſtanding-harmony with <hi>Providence.</hi> Some difference there may be as the ſtate of man is conſidered before the fall of our firſt Parents; and as God of old did preſcribe ſome Rules to the <hi>Jews,</hi> with which his <hi>Providence</hi> did keep pace; and likewiſe in reſpect of the Lord's more immediate owning and ruling that people: A difference there is in theſe and ſuch like reſpects; but yet not ſuch as doth overturn the Harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: Providence</hi> now hath its Harmony for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in ſome things; equivalent in other things with <hi>Providence</hi> in times of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>1. VVHAT a vanity and folly is it then for perſons to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about other pretended Harmonies? If there be ſuch bread in the Father's Houſe, what have the Children to do with husks? There are a ſort of baſtard-Harmonies cry'd up, and doted on, which want a Scripture-legitimation. Theſe, like Worms, eat away the kernel of men's thoughts and affections from better things, and ſo leave an empty ſhell; which, though it do not break the teeth in cracking, yet defiles the mouth by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifi'd ſtuff in it.</p>
                     <p>1. There is the pretended Harmony of things with Judicial Aſtrological Predictions, <note place="margin">Porrò A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologi &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque alii divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natores, qui quaſi ſimiae Dei videri volunt, omnino deridendi ſunt. Nec enim fieri poteſt ut de rebus futuris contingentibus ac praeſertim liberis vera praedicent, niſi forte aliquando caſu veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem attingant; nam cum omnibus cauſis neceſſariis, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus, liberis, voluntas Dei praeſideat &amp; prae-emineat, &amp; poffit cauſas inferiores, quando libuerit impedire; nemo vera praedicere poteſt, niſi cui Deus voluntatem ſuam manifeſtare voluerit, ut ſaepe prophetis ſuis manifeſtavit. <hi>Bellar.</hi> in opuſc. de aſcenſione mentis ad Deum. qu. 12.</note> which are not founded on right Reaſon, or general Experience. Some make bold to bring forth the Decrees of the Starr-Chamber as touching the bent of men's minds, the deaths of perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if ſo be there were not a ſecret Council-Table within the be-ſpang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Canopy of Heaven. There is little reaſon, and leſs grace, for men to be curiouſly ſearching
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:101303:189"/> after ſome Fopperies in Almanacks, and this to the neglect of their Bibles, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be out of date. If men would ſearch into the later, as they do into the former, they might read of an <hi>Eſau</hi> and a <hi>Jacob,</hi> twins-born, but of a different character, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 23. They might read of many thouſands dying a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death nigh one and the ſame time, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 10. and if an <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> had been conſulted, is it likely that he had made ſuch a difference as to <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſuch an Harmony of the deaths of an Hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, as the laſt Scripture mentions? Again, they might read, <hi>that promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth,</hi> Pſal. 75. 6. Furthermore, they might read a Sacred inſulting Irony, <hi>Let now the aſtrologers, the ſtarr-gazers, the monthly-prognoſticators, ſtand up, and ſave thee from the things that ſhall come upon thee,</hi> Iſa. 43. 13. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They might peruſe a Dehortatory Leſſon; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not diſmayed at the ſigns of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the heathens are diſmayed at them,</hi> Jer. 10. 2.</p>
                     <p>2. There is another baſtard Harmony in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of particular blind Prophecies caſt forth from Wizards and Witches, the Oracles of the Devil. There is in ſome a wicked Curioſity to know their Fortune, as it is phraſed. If ſuch would know their Fortune, they might take a ſhorter and ſurer courſe by reading the 28 ch. of <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> or, if they like not ſo large a Diſcourſe, they may have it in ſhort from
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:101303:189"/> Chriſt, who tells them, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 16. It is often a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious ſign of hardneſs of heart, and a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary deſerting by the Lord, when thus the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the Devil are in requeſt with parties. <hi>Seek me out</hi> (ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> to his ſervants) <hi>a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath a familiar ſpirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. 7. and what got he, but further ſorrow and wo? ſee ver. 20.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it will be objected here by ſome, That Prophecies, ſo termed, do fall out true; and therefore why are they not to be look't af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
                     <p>To this thred-bare Objection, note the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reply, and that in divers particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. Why are not things obſerved to fall out otherwiſe ordinarily? <note place="margin">Sciunt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li (daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra multa, ſed non omnia, quippe quibus penitus conſilium Dei ſcire non licet: &amp; ideo ſolent reſponſa in ambiguos exitus temperare. <hi>Lact.</hi> lib. 2. Inſtit. cap. 15.</note> 
                        <q rend="inline">An <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> or <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeper</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) is to be likened to one who ſelleth Dice, and ſaith, Behold here I have Dice that always run upon Twelve; the reſt of the fifty Caſts upon 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Even thus it is with <hi>Aſtrologers:</hi> When once or twice their Conceits and Fantaſies do hit and happen, then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently extol and praiſe the Art; but touching the other ſo oftentimes failing, they are altogether ſtill and ſilent.</q> Thus <hi>Luther.</hi> And indeed it's no wonder if ſometimes
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:101303:190"/> that which is ſpoken (and yet it may be in the general, or in an ambiguous ſenſe) do thus or thus fall out. Suppoſe divers in <hi>Iſrael</hi> had had recourſe to Witches, or others, to enquire what weather ſhould have been on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Is it not wheat-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt to day? I will call unto the Lord, and be ſhall ſend thunder and rain,</hi> 1 Sam. 12 17. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, none had hit right: ſuppoſe one had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many (for ſome kind of weather muſt be); now this one ſpeaks the truth, but not truly; having no ground, but as the blind man ſhoots the Hare.</p>
                     <p>2. Whether ſome kind of Predictions may have ſome influence by way of a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſality, to bring about what is ſaid. A true Prophecy may have ſome influence in an ordinary way to further the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it ſelf: ſo 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy there was the occaſion at leaſt for the Army-men to ſet up <hi>Jehu.</hi> And ſo, on the other hand, ſome paſſages heeded may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the thing. A man hath a ſtrong conceit of death, he is foretold ſo; and this phancy may, through <hi>Providence</hi> righteous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> have its deadly operation.</p>
                     <p>3. Satan can give notable intelligence to ſome who are his Oracles: For, <note place="margin">Angeli in verbo Dei cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt omnia, antequam in re ſiant: &amp; quae apud homines adhuc futura ſunt, Angeli jam revelante Deo, noverunt; praevaricatores Angeli etiam ſanctitate amiſſa, non tamen amiſerunt vivxis creaturae Angelicae ſenſum: triplici enim modo praeſcientiae acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine vigent; ſcilicet ſubtilitate naturae, experientiâ temporum, revelatione ſuperiorum poteſtatum. <hi>Iſid.</hi> Hiſp. lib. 1. ſent. c. 12.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. He is an Angel, and ſo hath a deeper
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:101303:190"/> inſight into matters. Though there may be ſome crack in his natural intellectuals by his fall; yet, as an Angel, he ſees further into matters: ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 17.</p>
                     <p>2. He hath had long experience as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world: He is an old Serpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
                     <p>3. He can quickly take cognizance of the poſition of matters, how things are in their precedent Cauſes both Natural and Moral. Thus ſuppoſing that it was the Devil in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Mantle, no wonder if he ſpeaks as he doth: for <hi>David</hi> was anointed, <hi>Saul</hi> grows worſe and worſe; and now the top-ſtone-Sinne, was laid on, namely, his going to a Witch, and a battel was at hand to be ſought.</p>
                     <p>4. The Devil hath a great ſtroak in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters brought about in the World. He that is then an Agitator, may the better be an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencer. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 21, 22. <hi>Job</hi> 1. 12. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan could know what would befall <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> when he had a Commiſſion, or rather a Permiſſion, what to do.</p>
                     <p>4. God hath wiſe Ends in the verification of what is ſometimes foretold. That place in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. is a full one for this purpoſe. <hi>Providence</hi> forbears not to go the journey, becauſe <hi>Satan</hi> doth ſo probably gueſs, and give it out: yea, <hi>Providence</hi> ſets forward the rather for the trial of perſons. And therefore let that pertinent inſtruction
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:101303:191"/> be remembred, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 19, 20. <hi>And when they ſhall ſay unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar ſpirits, and unto wizards, that peep and that mutter: ſhould not a people ſeek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law, and to the teſtimony: if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. There is a ſpecious expected Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Providence</hi> with Scriptures miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. It may be ſaid here to ſome, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 29. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> look for a <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> they are zealous for <hi>Moſes,</hi> and hot againſt Chriſt. What the Apoſtle ſaid of the <hi>Jews</hi> in his days [<hi>But even unto this day, when Moſes is read, the vail is upon their heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 15.] the ſame may be ſaid of their poſterity. Others there are, who (through error) faſten that on <hi>Providence</hi> to make good, which may never be. A pertinent paſſage for this purpoſe, we have John 21. 23. <hi>Then went this ſaying abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the brethren, That that diſciple ſhould not dye: yet Jeſus ſaid not to him, He ſhall not dye; but if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> This then is another falſe Harmony of <hi>Providence;</hi> and of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more is ſaid elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>II. Learn to depart from evil, and do good, according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 14. The moving-conſideration is drawn from the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101303:191"/> Harmony of <hi>Providence,</hi> which is two-fold:
<list>
                           <item>1. Joyous, ſprightful, or gracious.</item>
                           <item>2. Doleful, or grievous.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>This double Harmony of <hi>Providence</hi> ſeems to be pointed at in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: for in the fifteenth verſe it is ſaid, <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry.</hi> They then who would have the eye of God on them for good, and his ear open to their prayer, muſt ſee they depart from evil, and do good: they are not to have a deaf ear to this voice of the Lord. Again in verſe 16 it is ſaid, <hi>The face of the Lord is againſt them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. Providence</hi> will frown on ſuch who ſmile on ſin.</p>
                     <p>There is then encouragement from the Harmony of <hi>Providence,</hi> both in a way of Mercy and Wrath, to depart from evil, and do good. And whatever ſeeming-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety there is in regard of the proſperity of ſinners, and the adverſity of pious ones; yet it is a ſtanding-truth, That Joyous or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Providence</hi> is the portion of godly ones; and Doleful or Grievous <hi>Providence</hi> is the lot of wicked ones. The one have ſmiles in their frowns; and the other, real frowns in their ſmiles. Conſonant to this is that in the eighth of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and the twelfth verſe; <hi>Though a ſinner do evil an hundred times, and</hi>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:101303:192"/> 
                        <hi>his days be prolonged; yet ſurely I know, that it ſhall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</hi> To this of the Preacher, add that of the Prophet: <hi>Say unto the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, That it ſhall be well with him: for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings. Wo unto the wicked, for it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him,</hi> Iſa. 3. 10, 11.</p>

                     <p>THAT there is ſuch a neighbourhood of Whites and Blacks in the Diſpenſations of the Almighty, may be proved, if conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be had to the following heads of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are Similies, Alluſions, or Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations of this in Scripture. The Wind of <hi>Providence</hi> keeps not at one point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. So Eccleſ. 1. 6. <hi>The wind goeth towards the ſouth, and turneth about towards the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth again according to his circuits. I ſaw</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi>) <hi>in my viſion by night, and behold the four winds of the heaven ſtrove upon the great ſea,</hi> Dan. 7. 2. That notion of a Wheel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 15. doth ſet forth the rolling or turning-condition of things in the World. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten likewiſe is there an alluſion to the Sea, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2. We read of two notable
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:101303:193"/> Sea-voyages of the Diſciples of Chriſt, in which they might learn how the Church of Chriſt may have ſtorms and calms, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 22.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are Cautions, Dehortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Comminations, on the one hand; and Exhortations, Encouragements, Promiſes, on the other; which do imply this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hourhood of Whites and Blacks of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> So in Iſa. 1. 19, 20. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land: but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured with the ſword: for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> I might be large here: it may ſuffice to point at places: ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24, 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Prayers of God's People in Scripture do declare this. The 90<hi>th Pſalm</hi> is ſtiled, <hi>A Prayer of Moſes the man of God.</hi> Obſerve paſſages there. <hi>Return O Lord, how long:</hi> and, <hi>Let it repent thee now concerning thy ſervants.

                           </gap>cted us, and the years wherein we have ſeen evil,</hi> ver. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s prayer, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. looks backward on the <hi>Jews</hi> paſt both proſperous ſtate, and afflicted ſtate, for ſeventy years; and looks forward on a merciful Diſpenſation at hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There are certain Doxologies in Scripture, which take in this as matter of celebration or acknowledgment: So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:101303:193"/> 
                        <hi>The bows of the mighty men are broken; and they that ſtumbled, are girt with ſtrength: they that were full, have hired out themſelves for bread, and they that were hungry, ceaſed: ſo that the barren have born ſeven; and ſhe that hath many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is waxed feeble. The Lord killeth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth alive; he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up: he raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt; and lifteth up the begger from the dunghil, to ſet them among prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath ſet the world upon them.</hi> Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> in her Song of Thankfulneſs. See likewiſe the Doxology of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4. 34, 35, 36, 37. and of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Jeſus, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is ſomething as an adjunct oftentimes coupled with Adverſity, and with Proſperity; by reaſon or order of which, as precedaneous, a door is thrown open both for the one and the other. Here is indeed a Shop of Exchange. Adverſity, through a gracious <hi>Providence,</hi> makes way for Proſperity; and Proſperity, through a righteous <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> viſiting for Proſperity-ſins, makes way for Adverſity. <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> a King, ſins himſelf from his Throne: in his affliction he ſought God, was humbled greatly: the Lord was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of him, and brought him again to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 11, 12, 13. Pertinent for this purpoſe, is that in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 107. <hi>Fools, becauſe of their tranſgreſſion, and becauſe of</hi>
                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:101303:194"/> 
                        <hi>their iniquities, are afflicted: their ſoul abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all manner of meat; and they draw nearer to the gates of death: then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, be ſaveth them out of their diſtreſſes,</hi> v. 17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There is a Divine Conſtitution of Heaven for wiſe Ends, why this is ſo, and ſhall be ſo. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells of a day of Proſperity, and a day of Adverſity; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over affixeth this, ſaying, <hi>God alſo hath ſet the one over againſt the other, to the end that man ſhould find nothing after him,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 14. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity (ſaith one) is ſet oppoſite to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi>
                        </note> a Vale againſt a Hill, in a continual viciſſitude and ſucceſſion; and this is done to the end, or in ſuch order and manner, that man ſhould, or ſhall, find nothing after him, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe things that may come upon him in the courſe of his life, and after-times: he cannot by wit fore-ſee, nor by policy prevent, enſuing changes; and therefore it is a great part of his wiſdom to arm himſelf with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for all adventures.</p>
                     <p>In this Conſtitution of Heaven for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture <note place="margin">Si triſtia ſemper accide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, quis fuſtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret? ſi ſemper proſpera, quis non contemneret? ſed rerum tanta gubernatrix ſapientia horum perneceſſariâ viciſſitudine eo moderamine ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti, ſuis curſum vitae temporalis alternat, ut nec adverſa fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, nec laeta diſſolvant, cum potius &amp; iſta ex illis gratiora, &amp; illa ex his tolerabiliora reddantur. <hi>Bern.</hi> in Epiſtola ad <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Horſe goes well over the Plain; a rough way is at hand, where it may ſtumble, and diſmount the Rider: yea, it may happen, the Horſe may trip on the Plain; ſome little hillock, or looſe ſtone in the way, may occaſion a fall. <hi>And in my proſperity I ſaid</hi> (but God ſaid not ſo, though <hi>David</hi> ſaid ſo) <hi>I ſhall never be moved.

There is an evil of Deſpondency under evils of Smart. (2) Good perſons, yea, eminently good, are incident to ſome grumblings or touches at
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:101303:195"/> leaſt of this Diſeaſe. (3.) Parties notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their black Concluſions from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Affairs, may experience God's kindneſs. (4.) Perſons may even then be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mercy, or Mercy neareſt them, when they deem it furtheſt off.

Even then when <hi>Saul</hi>'s glaſs was nigh done, a few ſands to run: ſo that he who did conclude his life would be concluded by <hi>Saul</hi>'s violence; he that talks of falling by the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> hears tidings of <hi>Saul</hi>'s fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by the hand of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. chap.</p>
                     <p>3. Take a view of the Checker-Table of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> obſerve the revolutions that are in the world; let not the Whites and Blacks be paſſed over without a good improvement. It is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>And thou ſhalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee theſe forty years in the wilderneſs—</hi> Note here, how it's the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> duty to call to remembrance, or keep up in memory the way, and all the ways of God's Diſpenſations towards them: they, in their Wilderneſs-journey, had ups and downs; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Judgments were attendants; and they are not to forget what might profitably be learn't in the company of ſuch attendants on them in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:101303:196"/>
                     <p>There are, moreover, two inducements, why perſons ſhould take a view of this Checker-Table: (1.) It's plain or obvious to men's eyes. The Whites and Blacks of the Lord's Diſpenſations are the more viſible. The walk of <hi>Providence</hi> from one point to a diametrically oppoſite point, or from the Hill to the Vale, and from the Vale to the Hill, be ſpeaks men to be ſand-blind, or pur-blind, if it be not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thus it's implied in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>He hath put down the mighty from their ſeats, and exalted them of low degree; he hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath ſent empty away,</hi> v. 52, and 53. They then are very deaf, or have an injudicious ear, who hear not the loud Bell of <hi>Providence</hi> in ſuch changes which befal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others. (2.) As this Checker-table is plain or obvious to the eye; ſo is it a large one. There are many whites and blacks. There are not only the whites and blacks in regard of Temporals, but alſo in regard of Spirituals. Our Saviour tells the Jews, ſaying, <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,</hi> Mat. 21. 43. A wonderful change! and that reciprocal or mutual, as it reſpects different ſubjects, there is this way; according to that in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>—And it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there it ſhall be ſaid unto them, Te are the ſons of the living God.</hi> Again, theſe whites and blacks not only in reſpect of perſons ſingly conſidered; but in reſpect of a Community or Society of perſons. That paſſage, <hi>—that there</hi>
                        <pb n="377" facs="tcp:101303:196"/> 
                        <hi>be no complaining in our ſtreets,</hi> Pſal. 144. 14. doth imply the different ſtate of a Nation in regard of Temporal Mercies. We read in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt thorowout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria,—</hi> And we read likewiſe, how the Reſt there was not an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                     <p>4. Long then for an Heaven, or the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt. There is no ſuch Checker-table there. Be willing, however, that this Sacred Game of <hi>Providence</hi> be at an end. Beware of fooliſh paſſion, and irregular deſires of death. Let God alone to time all. The longeſt Game of <hi>Providence</hi> here in matters, will have its end. Meditate on that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>For we that are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burdened; not that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon; that mortality might be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of life.</hi>

                     <p>1. There are many Exemplifications of this Verity. <hi>Noah</hi> muſt change his habitation, he ſhut up in the Ark as in a Priſon: There are beaſts within, for his fellow-Priſoners; and ſad deſolations without, amongſt the Beaſts, and Men, the worſe Beaſts in a moral ſenſe: all this is afflictive. But yet his being in the Ark in order to his preſervation, was a ſignal favour; for ſo the Lord gives him to underſtand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 1. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Lot</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:101303:197"/> priſoner, but not ſlain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> had a Priſon-palace, or a Palace-priſon, <hi>for the Lord was with him, and ſhewed him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and gave him favour in the ſight of the keeper of the priſon,</hi> Gen. 31. 21. <hi>Moſes</hi> is caſt as an Exile into the Land of <hi>Midian,</hi> and there God provides for him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 21. God takes away <hi>David</hi>'s Child by death, who might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as an upbraiding Monument of <hi>David</hi>'s ſhame, ſo an occaſion of Warr in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Jonah</hi> is ſwallowed by a Whale, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. 17. the fiſh's belly is his houſe of prayer; and <hi>Jonah</hi>'s prayer is a prevailing-one: he who had a providential ingreſs, hath a glorious egreſs; <hi>The Lord ſpake unto the fiſh, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land,</hi> Jon. 2. 10. Our Saviour tells his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter ſhall not come unto you: but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you,</hi> Joh. 16. 7. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt ſuffer ſhipwrack, and yet none of their lives in the Ship are loſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 44. The ſame Man of God hath a thorn in the fleſh, a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him; yet this thorn is to open a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for whatever Impoſthumed-pride was gathered to an head: The Devil, an unclean Spirit, becomes providentially a ſanctifying-one in a ſenſe. God knows how to make the Devil do a good choar for a Saint, whilſt the Devil intends his own work. <hi>Paul</hi> was of this belief, as he profeſſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
                     <p>2. There are various wiſe ends in ſuch mix't Diſpenſations: Amongſt others, we may caſt
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:101303:198"/> an eye on theſe. (1.) Sometimes he makes a diſplay of fatherly diſpleaſure. There is a Rod, but it is a gentle one; <hi>Thou ſhalt not dye; but the child ſhall ſurely dye,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 13, 14. (2.) God will hereby wiſely exerciſe the graces of his people, as their faith and patience, by the bitter part of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; and their love to him, admiration of him, and thankfulneſs for favour by the ſweeter part of the Diſpenſation. Thus <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> ſickneſs, yet not death; and <hi>Paul</hi>'s danger of being devoured by the <hi>Roman</hi> Lion, had their influences on their graces, according to the interwoven mixture in theſe Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16, 17. (3.) Hereby the Lord wiſely conſults an Antidote and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt two Evils, namely, Pride and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency. <hi>Jacob</hi> is not to be dejected; he is a Prevailer: he is not to be elated; for he halted upon his thigh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28, 31. God's Diſpenſations are like well-levell'd Cannons, which beat upon Pride and Deſpondency, and ſo make ſweeping-work with each of theſe files at once. (4.) The Lord teacheth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency of his <hi>Providence</hi> with his <hi>Word.</hi> We are leſſon'd not to ſlight Heaven's Rod, which hath its ſmarting-blow: and not to faint; for its blow is from a Father, not an implacable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 11, 12. (5.) Hereby God will put a difference betwixt Earth and Heaven. <hi>Paul</hi> will have no need of a Thorn in the fleſh, when he is taken Tenant to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance. The joys of Saints in Heaven will run like a Cryſtal River, without
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:101303:198"/> mixture of mud or dirt. <hi>God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</hi> Rev. 7. 17.</p>

                     <p>1. LEARN what a wiſe God the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath for his God. The great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Heaven ſo attemperateth the Phyſick, as that it ſhall bear upon various ill humours. With one and the ſame Beeſom <hi>Providence</hi> ſweepeth the Saints houſe clean, to the joy and rejoycing of the Saint. The Ship is ſo managed, as that it neither overturns for want of ballaſt, nor ſinks into the ſea by reaſon of burthen. God doth balance the hearts of men, as well as balance the clouds over the heads of men, as is ſaid <hi>Job</hi> 37. 16. <hi>He is excellent in power and in judgment, and in plenty of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: he will not afflict,</hi> v. 23. And in Jer. 10. 24. <hi>O Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Beware then of fixing an eye only on the more gaſtly part of a Diſpenſation. View the bright ſide as well as the dark ſide of thy Cloud. There are two things here conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:</p>
                     <p>1. It is very rational or equitable, that a proportionable ſurveigh ſhould be taken of a Diſpenſation. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> after he had heard the Prophet's heavy tydings, ſaith, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord which thou haſt ſpoken, for there ſhall be peace and truth in my days,</hi> Iſa. 39. 8.</p>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:101303:199"/>
                     <p>2. As there is a robbing of the Lord in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his goodneſs and mercy in eying only the bitter part, as bitter, in Diſpenſation; ſo a perſon in ſo doing ſtands in the light of his own ſupport and comfort. He that can read Love, Mercy, Wiſdom, in the Characters of <hi>Providence,</hi> though written with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of Gall in their black Ink, will not tear in pieces the Letter ſent from Heaven. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> gives a large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miſeries, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 21. and in <hi>v.</hi> 22. what ſaith he? <hi>It is of the Lord's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fail not.</hi> Here is a ſenſe of Mercies, as well as before a ſenſe of Miſeries; and a good uſe is made of this in <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>It is good that a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>THIS Retaliating-work of <hi>Providence</hi> may be conſidered both by way of frown and ſmile; or, as grievous in a way of ſmart, and gracious in a way of favour. Each of theſe have a correſpondence with what is forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either by way of proportion literal (if I may ſo term it), there is a Copy or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane of the former Deed; or (as is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly ſaid) <hi>the ſame bread which men break to others, is broken to them again:</hi> or by way of proportion equivalent, or in value.

                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:101303:200"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are Aſſertions in Scripture on this wiſe: Theſe Aſſertions are,
<list>
                           <item>1. General.</item>
                           <item>2. Particular.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>1. The Aſſertions general which do point at this, are to be ſpoken to. And here, not to be large, hear what He aſſerteth, whoſe word may well be taken, Chriſt himſelf: <hi>Judg not, that ye be not judged: for with what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ye judg, ye ſhall be judged: and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſur'd to you again,</hi> Mat. 7. 1, 2. Compare this Scripture with <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 37, 38. and we have the Text, or Subject-matter, enlarged: for thus it is ſaid, <hi>Judg not, and ye ſhall not be judged; condemn not, and ye ſhall not be condemned: forgive, and ye ſhall be forgiven: give, and it ſhall be given unto you good meaſure, preſſed down, and ſhaken together, and running over, ſhall men give into your boſome: for with the ſame meaſure that ye mete withal, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. There are Aſſertions in particular, and that as they point at frowning-Diſpenſations and ſmiling-ones. The firſt ſort of Aſſertions in particular, as they reſpect wrath, we have ſcattered up and down in Scripture. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 1. <hi>Wo to thee that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled; and dealeſt treacherouſly, and they dealt not treacherouſly with thee: when thou ſhalt ceaſe to ſpoil, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled; and when thou ſhalt make an end to deal treacherouſly, they ſhall deal treacherouſly with thee.</hi> Rev. 13. 10.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:101303:200"/> 
                        <hi>He that leadeth into captivity, ſhall go into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: he that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The later ſort of Aſſertions in particular we have likewiſe on Sacred Record. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poor; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble: the Lord will preſerve him, and keep him alive, and he ſhall be bleſſed upon the earth, and thou wilt not deliver him to the will of his enemies: the Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing; thou wilt make his bed in ſickneſs,</hi> v. 1, 2, 3. To this add one Scripture more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 25. <hi>With the merciful thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf merciful: with the upright thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf upright.</hi> And that in Mat. 5. 7. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Prayers that are in Scripture recorded, do imply a Retaliating-work of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> There are Sacred or Divinely-inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red reflections on the evil and good deeds of perſons; and theſe reflections have reached Heaven for an anſwer: ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 7. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, the children of Edom, in the day of Jeruſalem; who ſaid, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.</hi> So likewiſe, Lam. 1. 22. <hi>Let all their wickedneſs come before thee; and do unto them as thou haſt done unto me for all my tranſgreſſions: for my ſighs are many, and my heart faint.</hi> And Rev. 6. 7. <hi>And they cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judg and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, there are paſſages in Prayer of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:101303:201"/> aſpect or reflection. <hi>Boaz anſwered and ſaid to Ruth, It hath fully been ſhewed me, all that thou haſt done unto thy mother-in-law ſince the death of thy husband; and how thou haſt left thy father, and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity; and art come unto a people which thou kneweſt not heretofore. The Lord recompenſe thy work, and a full reward be given to thee of the Lord God of Iſrael, under whoſe wings thou art come to truſt,</hi> Ruth 2. 11, 12. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>give mercy unto the houſe of Oneſiphorus, for he oft refreſhed me, and was not aſhamed of my chain,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There are Exemplifications of a Retaliating-work; and that,
<list>
                           <item>1. By way of Wrath, or Judgment, or Severity.</item>
                           <item>2. By way of Mercy.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. To begin with the firſt ſort: The firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſlain, and that very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, if conſideration be had to the bloody Edict for the deſtroying the male-children of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and look, as Orders were iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to drown the children of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>'s River; ſo <hi>Pharoah</hi> with his Hoſt are drowned in the Red-ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 16. and <hi>v.</hi> 22. with <hi>Exod</hi> 12. 29. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 30. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> tells <hi>Agag, As thy ſword hath made wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men childleſs, ſo ſhall thy mother be childleſs among women; and Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 23. Vengeance is for <hi>Edom;</hi> and why? Becauſe that <hi>Edom</hi> hath
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:101303:201"/> dealt againſt the houſe of <hi>Judah</hi> by taking vengeance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. 12, 13, 14. <hi>O Jeruſalem</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>which killeſt the prophets, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt them which are ſent unto thee—behold now your houſe is left unto you deſolate,</hi> Luke 13. 34, 35. It is ſaid, Rev. 16. 6. <hi>—for they have ſhed the blood of ſaints and prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</hi> And in Rev. 18. 6. <hi>Reward her, even as ſhe rewarded you; and double unto her double, according to her works: in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double.</hi> Many inſtances are there in Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hiſtory, which do abundantly witneſs this. It may be obſerved how the ſins of Fraud, Perjury, Oppreſſion, Blood, are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Capital Characters on the foreheads of after-puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>The next ſort of Exemplifications come to be ſpoken to. The Midwives, who did not ſet their hands to pull down the props of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> houſes (I mean, the Male-children), have houſes made for them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 21. God's making of them houſes there, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in regard of propagation or encreaſe of poſterity; their Vines ſpread, who did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the young Plants: or in regard of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; their Houſes or Families are made illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious: They who honoured God, and his people too, in an afflicted condition; are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by God. Or, laſtly, in regard of wealth or proſperous eſtate; they are bleſt with a confluence of good things, who would not be inſtrumental to rob the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of their beſt
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:101303:202"/> living goods. <hi>Lot</hi> ſhews kindneſs to Angels in the ſhape of men; and he who would defend his Gueſts, is defended by them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 1, <hi>&amp;c. David</hi> ſhews kindneſs to <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> for <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s ſake; having received kindneſs from the Father, he makes conſcience of paying of the debt of kindneſs to the Son, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 7.</p>
                     <p>There are Exemplifications of this verity in Hiſtory. That relation Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> makes of <hi>Freſeobalt</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Florence,</hi> is pertinent here. He was very bountiful to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lord Chancellor of <hi>England;</hi> and found the counterpain of his bounty in <hi>Florence,</hi> at <hi>London:</hi> for coming thither to get in ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys due to him in <hi>England,</hi> he being now in a low eſtate, finds one high enough, namely, the ſaid Lord, for his help and relief. By the aſſiſtance of the Chancellor, his debts due are paid: and the money which this Merchant gave, or rather lent, to the other, being in a mean and diſtreſſed condition, is refunded with noble Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Eight hundred Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats for about Fifty, disburſed in order to <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s return to <hi>England.</hi> In the Life of that famous Preacher in his Age, <hi>Lavater,</hi> there is a memorable ſtory of <hi>Providence</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliating kindneſs for kindneſs to <hi>Lavater</hi> his Father. He being a Military-man, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on a common Soldier labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great extremity by reaſon of thirſt at a very hot ſeaſon: though he were an Officer of note, yet he took cognizance of a diſtreſſed Soldier, and liberally refreſh't him with a
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:101303:202"/> draught of Wine which he had by him in ſome veſſel at that time. It happens, about eight years after, that <hi>Lavater</hi> in a certain fight falls into a Ditch or Trench where many had periſhed; neither was there any hope that he ſhould get out from thence: but behold, that very Soldier put forth his hand in the very ſight of the Enemies, with great danger of his life, and plucks <hi>Lavater</hi> from the jaws of death; who is now delivered, and after returns home to his Command, and enquires who it was that ſo hazzarded himſelf for him, wills the man to come before him; asks him, what was the reaſon he ſo jeoparded his life. The Soldier replies, Becauſe thou ſome years heretofore, when I was likely to periſh by reaſon of thirſt, in <hi>Italy,</hi> didſt relieve me in my extremity. In the Life of learned and pious <hi>Junius,</hi> it is mentioned, how being at a great diſtance from his friends, and Warr breaking forth in <hi>France,</hi> ſo that he could not have moneys ſent him; he was in very great want, ſo that he was reſolved to dig for a Livelihood in the City-trench of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> and ſo relieve himſelf that way, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what time he could otherwhile to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Book. Being thus diſtreſſed, one <hi>William Burdo,</hi> who was a Taylor there, having been out in the Civil-Warrs of <hi>France,</hi> and lately eſcaped with his life, takes notice of <hi>Junius</hi> going from a Sermon; and doubtful whether it were <hi>Junius,</hi> who was
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:101303:203"/> now in a poor condition as to ſight, asks him, who was aſham'd to diſcover himſelf, and ſo finds him to be his Countrey man, hath him to his Lodging, telling him he would work to get enough for a ſubſiſtence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould be paid again from <hi>Junius</hi> his friends: and ſo he did, and was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo to do, conſidering what kindneſs his Mother (being a Widow-woman, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many Children) had received from <hi>Junius</hi> his Mother, who was a religious and bountiful Matron, and did daily ſend relief to the Widow-woman and her Children, living near her houſe. One of her Children was this <hi>William,</hi> who now is an helper to him, whoſe Mother had been an helper. Who knows to whom he may be beholding to one time or other! Good acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are Bills of Exchange, when no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is in the Purſe. <hi>He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given, will he pay him again,</hi> Prov. 19. 17.</p>

                     <p>I. IN reference then to Frowning-Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Providence,</hi> obſerve theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Documents.</p>
                     <p>1. There is ground to repent for Injuries done to others. There may be a ſad reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Providence</hi> behind. They who imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others lives, may have their lives imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by others. The King of <hi>Nineveb</hi> with his Nobles act wiſely, when it is thus enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands,</hi> Jonah 3. 8. The ſucceſs of humbling and reforming-work, is made mention in the tenth verſe.</p>
                     <p>2. Acknowledg God's righteous hand, when the evil of our ſins are written thus on the fore-heads of our Smarts. An <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezeck</hi> feels the righteous hand of <hi>Providence</hi> in his thumbs cut off; and the trampling foot of <hi>Providence,</hi> in treading on, yea off, his great toes: <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>3. There is hope of the Lord's helping perſons under the furies of men, from the conſideration of Retaliating-Providence. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 8. <hi>O daughter of Babylon, who art to be deſtroyed, happy ſhall he be that rewardeth thee as thou haſt ſerved us.</hi> Obad. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>For</hi>
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:101303:204"/> 
                        <hi>the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou haſt done, it ſhall be done unto thee; thy reward ſhall return upon thine own head.</hi> See alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 20, with 24.</p>
                     <p>4. Beware of unrighteous acts towards others, whether Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Husbands, Wives, Widows, Fatherleſs. It is ſtoried of an aged man, who being bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly dragged by the hair of the head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his ſon (who abuſed him) he would not drag him beyond ſuch a place of the houſe, for that he did not ſo to his Father. It's ſaid, how ſome ſecond Husbands pay home the firſt Husbands ſcores; and ſo of Wives too often it is experienced. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> refuſed to obey the voice of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> their Governour, and they ſmarted for it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8 19. They who ſlight good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, may be puniſh't with bad ones. There may be Watch-men which may ſmite ſome for their ſmiting, and wound for their wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 7. That is a notable caution gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. <hi>Ye ſhall not afflict any widow, or fatherleſs child; if thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry at all unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry, and my wrath ſhall wax hot, and I will kill you with the ſword, and your wives ſhall be widows, and your children fatherleſs,</hi> verſe 22, 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>II. In reference to Smiling-Retaliations of <hi>Providence,</hi> remember the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:101303:204"/>
                     <p>1. The leſs ground there is of dejection under ſtraits, by how much the more parties have been helpful to others under their ſtraits. <hi>For God</hi> (ſaith the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) <hi>is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have ſhewed towards his name, in that ye have miniſtred to the ſaints, and do miniſter,</hi> Heb. 6 10. <hi>Job</hi> was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, a father to the poor, the bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon him, <hi>Job</hi> 29. He hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience after his ſharp Winter-ſeaſon, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliating-Smiling-Providence; his Brethren, Siſters, and all that had been of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, afford him heart and hand for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and conſolation, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 11.</p>
                     <p>2. Take notice, how God hath been a gracious Pay-Maſter to you one way or other. The debts of kindneſs are paid off in money, or as good, if not better, than money. Old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> who had a loyal heart and a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand towards <hi>David</hi> in his flight from <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom,</hi> experienceth the King's favour to him and his: ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 27, 28, 29. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 38, 39.</p>
                     <p>3. Take encouragement then, to put on bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, as is ſaid <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2. How many are there, of whom it may be ſaid, They have guts, but no bowels of compaſſion towards others afflicted! Forget not, more eſpecially, to have a reſpect to God's ſervants, whether ſtrictly, or generally ſo
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:101303:205"/> termed. It's an encouraging meditation we have in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 4, 5, 6. compared with 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. the good Prophet, though dead, is yet a virtual ſpokeſman to the King for that woman who had been hoſpitable in entertaing him at her houſe: her ſparing the Prophet a little room, is richly requited with the King's reſtoring her the whole Houſe, Lands, Profits or Iſſues thence ariſing from the time of her abſence, to the time of her addreſs made to the King there. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member then that of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 41. <hi>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall receive a prophets reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, ſhall receive a righteous man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>

                     <p>TIME and Place put weight into the Scale of Moral Actions: Virtue and Vice have an aggravation, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Time and Place. And as Time and Place have their conſideration in Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, ſo in the Diſplays of <hi>Providence.</hi> God, who is the Author of Time and Place, doth wiſely govern Matters with reſpect to Time and Place.</p>
                     <p>To begin then with the firſt of theſe; and ſo it will not be loſt time to take a view of <hi>Providence</hi> about the timing of things. And here three Poſitions offer themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It belongs to God, as his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Royal, to Time Matters. In Iſa. 60. 22. <hi>I the Lord will haſten it in his time.</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the ſeaſons which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put in his own power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:101303:206"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Lord, who is wiſe, doth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Time matters. This appears, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,</p>
                     <p>1. That the Scripture not only ſpeaks of Time, but of a fulneſs of Time; which notes the mature, exact, or fit bringing-forth of matters on the ſtage of this world. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt came in the fulneſs of time, as we read it aſſerted once and again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                     <p>2. There is no ſolid reaſon for man to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Lord's Timing of Matters. For, (1.) Hereby folly is exalted, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Say not thou, What is the cauſe that the former days were better than theſe? for thou doſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire wiſely concerning this.</hi> (2.) Men have ſmarted for their folly, when they will have other times, or things timed according to their diſcontented humours. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt have fleſh-days; they ſhall have them, and enough of them, ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 32, 33.</p>
                     <p>3. As there is reaſon, ſo it's man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be calm, and not fooliſhly ſtumbled at this or that about Times. There are two ways how times may be ſaid to be evil:
<list>
                           <item>1. In regard of the evils of Sin.</item>
                           <item>2. In regard of the evils of Smart.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for evil times in regard of Sin, though it be our duty to groan, yet not to grudg or mutter againſt the Lord becauſe ſuch times are. Times are bad; and by an undue diſcontent they are not made better, but worſe. There is a wiſe and good <hi>Providence</hi>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:101303:206"/> of God, when Times are thus bad. Divers things might here be inſiſted on; I ſhall only point at one, and that is, The truth of his Word which hath foretold of ſuch times; and this, if conſidered, may not only break the force of temptation, as if God did not govern the world at ſuch times; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe confirm us in the faith. In the time of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> was ſo far offended at the ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, that he called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, till he was better reſolved and ſetled in the point by <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova,</hi> who evidenced to him, That it was long ſince foretold of ſuch days of defection and abomination, when iniquity ſhould abound, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, as for bad times in regard of the evil of Smart, there is leſs ground for diſquiet, if ſin be conſidered of as ordinarily preceding ſuch evils of Smart. The Scarlet and Crimſon Sins make way for Garments rolled and dyed in blood. It was a pious confeſſion in Ezra 9. 23. <hi>Howbeit, thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us: for thou haſt done right, but we have done wickedly.</hi> And where the days are black and bloody ones, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they who are killed, burned, maſſacred, keep their garments undefiled, being perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for righteouſneſs ſake; yet God is good in ſuch bad times as theſe. Much might be ſaid in way of an apology for <hi>Providence</hi> here. It may ſuffice, That they who do ſuffer, are ſweetly ſatisfied as to what is their lot and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:101303:207"/> portion in this kind. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>It was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets this place as having reference to the times of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> and quotes an obſervable reply of ſome of them to the Argument drawn from the ſucceſs of the Popiſh party againſt them, namely, That they were the conquered peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt. The Scripture had foretold of what ſhould be, and ſo what might make againſt them, makes for them. They were overcom'd, and yet did overcome by their faith and patience. The Wild-Boar of the Foreſt did chaſe them to their Father's Houſe. A time comes when Chriſt plays the mighty Huntſman, and ſo ſlays the ſlayer, to the glory of His Vindictive Juſtice.<note place="margin">Nam cum Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Tolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedens, eos, qui adhuc re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentoriis forte manſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſo, ut tanto quaſi Dei irati, &amp; contra eos pronunciantis flagello convicti, jam tandem feritate depoſitâ ad fidem quam vocant Catholicam converterentur; illi verò ſe populum Chriſti victum retorquentes hoc quaſi cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peo, tentationis impetum fruſtrati ſunt at<expan>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a glorious diſſplay of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in timing both Mercies and Judgments. Mercies are timed, and ſo timed, as that they are oftentimes inhanced from the ſeaſon for them. God did remember <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's forgetting of him; for <hi>Joſeph</hi> is reſerved till he be more fitted for releaſe, and till <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be at a loſs about his dreams, for the Magicians could not interpret them unto <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Gen.</hi> 41. 8.

                        <hi>Daniel</hi>'s caſe; between whoſe intended ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and advancement there was but a little time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>with following verſes.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the time of Mercy doth ſometimes lead to, or point at, ſome duty, which the Lord graciouſly recompenceth at ſuch time. The day of ſetting upon Temple-work, is a day of God's bleſſing them from thence, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 18, 19. It is obſerved, how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had victory gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Mon. in the Hiſtory of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixth.</note> unto them on that very day and hour Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were burnt at <hi>London.</hi> And as for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Lord times them. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> goes not againſt an hypocritical Nation, till God ſends them, <hi>Iſa</hi> 10. 6. God knows how to make a Calamity a double one, in regard of the timing of it. That paſſage in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20. doth plainly atteſt ſo much. Moreover, the day of Calamity may point out at ſin committed on the day that Calamity is inflicted. <hi>While the word</hi> (a proud one) <hi>was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Dan. 4. 31. Time is ſometimes a Glaſs to behold the ſin committed then, or before, at ſuch a time, which hath its recourſe when the Judgment is inflicted. The day, week, month of Smart, may point to the day, week, month, of Sin, before.</p>
                     <p>The Second Branch of the Obſervation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to Places. And here three Propoſitions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe offer themſelves to conſideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some Places are Monuments of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in regard of what falls out there. <hi>Surely</hi>
                        <pb n="400" facs="tcp:101303:208"/> (ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not: he ſet up a pillar, and called the name of the place Bethel,</hi> Gen: 28. 16, 17, 18, 19. See moreover, for this purpoſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 12. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is much of <hi>Providence</hi> in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Places, and in abſence of parties from Places. A <hi>Levite</hi> lodgeth at <hi>Gibeah,</hi> Judg. 19. 14. and what falls out there, is the deſolation of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> no leſs than the lives of Twenty and five thouſand <hi>Benjamites</hi> pay the ſhot, or diſcharge that <hi>Levite</hi>'s Quarters, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 46.

There was much of <hi>Providence</hi> in <hi>Saul</hi>'s coming to <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead</hi> for their help, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Both Mercy and Wrath may be read in legible Characters on Places, and at Places. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God is ſeen in way of Mercy, as it reſpects the place it ſelf, in bleſſing of it, as he did the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Providence</hi> is diſplayed in way of mercy at places, and that in doing good to the ſouls of men, and to the outward man too. <hi>Many of the Jews which came to Mary</hi> (at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany</hi>) <hi>and had ſeen the things which Jeſus did, believed on him,</hi> John 11. 45. The blind man is in the way nigh <hi>Jericho,</hi> and Chriſt there paſſeth
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:101303:208"/> by, and healeth him, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 35. And as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is thus diſplayed, ſo Wrath likewiſe. <hi>The Lord turneth rivers into a wilderneſs, and the water-ſprings into dry grounds, a fruitful land into barrenneſs, for the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 107. 33, 34. The Brethren of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> are on their progreſs to viſit <hi>Ahab</hi>'s children at <hi>Samaria;</hi> they are met with by <hi>Jehu,</hi> and ſlain at the pit of the ſhearing-houſe, even two and forty men, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 13, 14. King <hi>Joram</hi> is providentially drawn forth from <hi>Jezreel,</hi> and met <hi>Jehu</hi> in the portion of <hi>Naboth</hi> the <hi>Jezreelite,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 21. he is ſlain by <hi>Jehu,</hi> and his body is thrown on that very plat, according to the word of the Lord, as <hi>Jehu</hi> makes the obſervation, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, of the ſame chapter.</p>

                     <p>1. FROM the Lord's timing of matters, learn, (1.) What ground there is for wicked ones to conſider of their ways. God not only times Puniſhment, but ſo times it, as that it may become double puniſhment. God hath turned the Glaſs of his Long-ſuffering in Heaven; how many ſands are run out, and how many are to run out, they know not: this let them know, That God will come in way of puniſhing, if they come not in way of repenting; he will come even to a ſand. When the iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> is full, vengeance
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:101303:209"/> ſteps in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 16. There is a <hi>MENE, God hath numbred thy kingdom, and finiſhed it,</hi> for a <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> Dan. 5. 25. And as the Lord timeth Wrath, ſo there is a ſtinging timing of it: Wicked ones have a ſpring-tide of Wrath, when they expected it not: ſo it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Iſa. 47. 9. <hi>But theſe two things ſhall come to thee in a moment, in one day; the loſs of children, and widowhood: they ſhall come upon thee in their perfection,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>v</hi> 11. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall evil come upon thee, thou ſhalt not know from whence it ariſeth; and miſchief ſhall fall upon thee, thou ſhalt not be able to put it off: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſhall come upon thee ſuddenly, which thou ſhalt not know.</hi> (2.) What ground is there for godly ones to wait on God in this <hi>Providence</hi> for mercy: God hath his timing of mercy, and ſo timing of it, as may the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the mercy. There is a bleſſed ſeaſon to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples came to Chriſt in a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time, to be ſtrengthned in the faith of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt knew when to fill <hi>Peter</hi>'s net with fiſh, after they had toiled all night, and caught nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 5, 6. <hi>Iſaac</hi> hath a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yoke-fellow after his Mother's death, and was comforted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 67.</p>
                     <p>2. From God's <hi>Providence</hi> in reference to Places: (1.) Let men be afraid of ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God in places: In the very places God can alarum them, and puniſh them. The King
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:101303:209"/> with his Carowſing-Courtiers, are appaled with the fingers of a man's hand, which came forth and wrote upon the plaiſter of the wall; yea, it is ſaid, <hi>In that night was Belſhazzar the king of the Chaldeans ſlain,</hi> Dan. 5. 5, 6, 7, 30. (2.) Obſerve Place-Providences. Let afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and mercies in reſpective places, have one place more, and that is the heart, to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and improve them. <hi>Jacob</hi> was bid to mind <hi>Bethel,</hi> a mercy of old there, and a duty incumbent on him upon the account of mercy vouchſafed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 1. The ſame <hi>Jacob</hi> takes notice of his Wife <hi>Rachel</hi>'s death, where ſhe dyed, and tells <hi>Joſeph</hi> of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 7. <hi>Paul</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat not his Aſian-trouble, and mercy withal, which whether it were a violent fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or hot perſecution, and deliverance from the one or other, it matters not; he obſerved the <hi>Providence</hi> of God there, and improveth it, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10, 11. the ſame Apoſtle hath brief obſervations on what happened in divers places of his Apoſtolical-pilgrimage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, <hi>to the end.</hi>

                     <p>IT hath been diſcuſſed, How God's <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is ſeen in Timing of matters: Now, amongſt other things, not only the timing, but ſo timing in regard of opportune help, is to be touched. And becauſe the <hi>Providence</hi> of God is wonderfully diſplayed on this wiſe, ſo that His actings of this nature are mold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a religious Aphoriſm or Sentence, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>In the mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen:</hi> It will be very pertinent to inſiſt on the ſeaſonable diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> under Diſtreſs or Difficulty. That paſſage in the Scripture quoted, may be ſtiled, <hi>A Providential Proverb;</hi> for ſo the words [<hi>as it is ſaid unto this day</hi>] in the Text there, do imply. The occaſion of this Sacred form of ſpeech, was the Lord's ſtepping in for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s help. There are three things to be noted:</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>That diſtreſs befalleth a perſon or a people.</hi> For ſo it was here with <hi>Abraham; Take now thy ſon, thine only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:101303:210"/>
                     <p>2. <hi>That a diſtreſs proves an abiding-one ſo long as God pleaſeth. Abraham</hi> travelleth on the firſt and ſecond day; no releaſe: and on the third day he lifts up his eyes, and ſaw the place afar off, <hi>v.</hi> 4. The ſight of the place muſt needs affect his heart; this <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or place of Skull, might make him hang down his head with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: his head might well have aked on both ſides, had he not had a hand of faith to hold it; and this he had, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth affirm, ch. 11. 17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>That Providence doth opportunely appear for diſtreſſed ones, by way of releaſe from troubles. Abraham</hi> muſt have the ſacrificing-knife in his hand to ſlay his ſon, ere the Angel of the Lord call unto him, ſaying, <hi>Lay not thy hand on the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him,</hi> &amp;c. What here was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe, is by way of proportion the caſes of others, who have their extremities, as God hath his opportunities for help: and that <hi>Providence</hi> hath thus its oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for help, will appear, if we conſider,

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Promiſes, formally and properly ſo termed, we have in Scripture. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 7, 8. doth give us to underſtand, That God's Promiſe of bringing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was not the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:101303:211"/> further off from fulfilling, though the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> had been long under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> yoke; and their yoke was made heavier a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord brake it to pieces. The Promiſe ſtood ſtill irreverſible, and in its full ſtrength, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were weakeſt: help was then neareſt, when they might think it furtheſt off, in regard of the bricks doubled.

                     <p>2. Come we next to Performances, or the Experiences of perſons. God remembred <hi>Noah</hi> after he had been ſhut up in the Ark, <hi>Gen</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Lot</hi> is reſcued timely by <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 14. 13. <hi>Sarah</hi> was taken into houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 2. and it is ſaid, God came to <hi>Abimilech</hi> in a dream, and ſaid, <hi>Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which thou haſt taken: for ſhe is a man's wife, ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Providence</hi> was ſeaſonable for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s chaſtity. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are at the Red-ſea, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> at their backs; they could neither drink up the one, nor eat up the other; no ordinary way of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: and yet then the Lord opens a way in the ſea, and a path in the mighty waters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21, 22. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſore diſtreſſed, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 9. then the Spirit of the Lord came upon <hi>Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah,</hi> and he becomes their deliverer, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 29. So it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſaw the affliction of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael that it was very bitter: for there was not any ſhut up, nor any left, nor any help for Iſrael; and the Lord ſaid not, that he would blot out the name of Iſrael from under heaven: but he ſaved them by the hand of Jeroboam the ſon of Joaſh,</hi> 2 King. 14. 26, 27. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in the briars, a knotty caſe offers it ſelf; and while he thought on theſe things, the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 20. The Diſciples of Chriſt were in the Ship, there aroſe a great tempeſt in the ſea, inſomuch that the Ship was covered
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101303:212"/> with the waves; they come to Chriſt, awake him, ſaying, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh:</hi> then he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe (after this ſtorm, and check given to them for the tempeſt of unbelief in their ſouls) and rebuked the winds and the ſea, and there was a great calm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24, 25, 26. Again, when the diſciples cry'd out for fear, ſtraightway Jeſus ſpake unto them, ſaying, <hi>Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid,</hi> Mat. 14. 26, 27. Chriſt appears timely to the Emmaus-diſciples under their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 17. And as the <hi>Jews</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> tidings came to the chief Captain of the Band, That all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was in an uproar; who immediately took Soldiers and Centurions, and ſo reſcued <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 21. 31, 32. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Siſter's ſon heard of the <hi>Jews</hi> lying in wait to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo there was a ſeaſonable prevention of the murderous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 16. <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was ſick unto the death; but the Lord had mercy on him, <hi>Phil</hi> 2. 27. Thus all theſe are inſtances of ſeaſonable help from Heaven under extremities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The variety of Ends which the Lord hath in the ſwelling of a diſtreſs, ere he apply the remedy; is the next thing to be inſiſted on. Theſe Ends ſubordinate to his will and pleaſure, may be reckoned up, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
                     <p>1. To chaſten for ſin. Great ſins call for grievous diſtreſſes. As men were ſwift in tranſgreſſing; ſo <hi>Providence</hi> may juſtly be ſlow in delivering.

                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 11. had reſolution to ſlay him, <hi>v.</hi> 20. commit Plagiary in ſelling their brother to the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> for he was not theirs to ſell, <hi>v.</hi> 28. with 40. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. They are after diſtreſſed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and Conſcience then rings them a peal, being ſo diſtreſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. Their diſtreſs riſeth higher and higher, for behold their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is in their Sacks-mouth, and hereupon their hearts failed them, and they were afraid, ſaying one to another, <hi>What is this that God hath done unto us?</hi> Gen. 42. 28. Neither is this all, but a hard task they have to get <hi>Benjamin</hi> from their Father, in order to the purgation of themſelves from being Spies; and no going again to <hi>Egypt</hi> without him; and if they go not, they muſt go down to their graves, for the famine was ſore in the Land, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 1, 2. At length <hi>Jacob</hi> is prevailed with to let <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> go; and then their diſtreſs evades a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative one; the killing-part of the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is acted; the Cup is found in <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s Sack; and according to their verdict <hi>Benjamin</hi> was to dye, and they to be bond-men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. 9. Now is the ſpring-tide of diſtreſs, which overflows all the banks, as appears from the pathetical Oration of <hi>Judah,</hi> who vents his ſorrows, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall we ſay unto my Lord? What ſhall we ſpeak? or how ſhall we clear our ſelves? God hath found out the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thy ſervants: we are my Lord's bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and he alſo with whom the cup is found,</hi> Gen. 44. 16. Now when their diſtreſs mounts to the clouds, help comes down from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: <hi>I am Joſeph</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſeph</hi>); <hi>I am Joſeph</hi>

                        <hi>your brother, whom ye ſold into Egypt.</hi> Gen. 45. 3, 4. To this inſtance add another: God did threaten the people by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> flood, which was to overflow, go over, and reach even to the neck, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 6. Accordingly it was accompliſhed: for the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> like a deluge of water, did overflow even to the head-City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which, like a man, ſtood up to the neck in theſe waters, the body of the nation being cover'd with them; and then the Lord, who ſets bounds, cauſeth the waters to return, as we have the ſtory in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 36, 37, 38. the [<hi>then there</hi>] in the Text, hath reference to the <hi>Jews</hi> doleful caſe when within the City; God hath then his Angel for their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in his pride is higheſt, and reſolved in an utter riddance of the Lord's people.</p>
                     <p>2. To diſ-engage or take off the heart from creature-dependency, and to call forth the faith for exerciſe on God. The greater the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes are, and no way viſible for help; the more is there a place for faith on God. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> narrows or ſtraitens the conditions of parties, that ſo there may be more room or enlargement for the exerciſe of faith. All Creature-twigs being lopt off, there is nothing left but to hang the more on the Creator. Faith will find ſomewhat to take hold on, when Senſe ſeeth nothing. <hi>I looked</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>on my right hand, and behold, but there was no man that would know me; refuge failed me: no man cared for my ſoul. I cried unto thee, O Lord: I ſaid, Thou art my refuge, and my portion</hi>
                        <pb n="411" facs="tcp:101303:213"/> 
                        <hi>in the land of the living,</hi> Pſal. 142. 4, 5. the like was <hi>Paul</hi>'s caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>3. To let men know, That the Lord he is God, and can help, notwithſtanding there is a viſible face of things to the contrary. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> ſhall out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and over the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, let Task-maſters, Horſes, Chariots, the mighty Waters, ſay the contrary. <hi>Now I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jethro</hi>) <hi>that the Lord is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them,</hi> Exod. 18. 11. That is notable in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s days, when the caſe was ſad at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> as that in Iſa. 37. 3. <hi>This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blaſphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not ſtrength to bring forth.</hi> And yet though thus ſaith <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> yet thus ſaith the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King of <hi>Aſſyria, He ſhall not come into this City, nor ſhoot an arrow there, nor come before it with ſhields, nor caſt a bank againſt it: by the way that he came, by the ſame ſhall, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and ſhall not come into this City, ſaith the Lord,</hi> v. 33, 34. God is the great Arbiter or Controller of things. He will be known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Mighties of the World; and one ſeaſon when he thus will be known, is when diſtreſſed ones know not what to do, but to ſigh and pray to him, who is great, and greatly to be praiſed, and feared above all gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 4.</p>
                     <p>4. To encourage praying-work. The Church of God in <hi>Eſther</hi>'s time, had, as it were, her neck on the block; the lifted-up hands hold up the lifted-up Ax from falling down, <hi>Eſth.</hi>
                        <pb n="412" facs="tcp:101303:214"/> 4. 16. Prayer was made without ceaſing for <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 12. 5. the Lord ſends an Angel, who procures a timely Gaol-delivery, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. As God doth call forth prayer in ſuch extremities (for our extremities call upon us to call upon God): ſo his goodneſs is ſeen in the anſwer made unto prayer; which may further be a Load-ſtone to this duty under the like extremities. It is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 17. <hi>He will regard the prayer of the deſtitute, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their prayer.</hi> O how oft have praying-ones had experience of God's regarding them, when in reſpect of their extremities, ſenſe and reaſon might be ready to prompt, as if the Lord had utterly rejected them! I remember here a memorable ſtory: There happened to be a Famine in a Ship, inſomuch that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was ſtarted about drawing lots who ſhould be eaten; one of note in the Ship, and a pious man withal, deſired the reſt, That they might firſt ſeek to God by prayer, before they reſolved to enact ſo inhuman a Butchery: and accordingly he made a prayer to God; and whilſt he was praying, a Fiſh of ſome bigneſs was caſt out of the ſea upon the place where he was praying: this Fiſh they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and though it were but a ſhort Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for hungry ones, yet it put a ſtop to a Fleſh-dinner for that time: but however, the belly hath no ears, hunger comes on, and the old queſtion about a bloody Fleſh-meal is ſtarted: The man who was their mouth to God in prayer, wills them, They might look up again to God, having had experience of his
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:101303:214"/> gracious <hi>Providence</hi> in the Fiſh: accordingly to prayer they go; and whilſt at prayer, a Fowl of conſiderable bigneſs flies a-thwart the Ship-tackling, and is entangled, which they had, and accordingly divided; and before any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther controverſie did ariſe, a Ship bears up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; and their diſtreſſed caſe being communicated, proviſion they had out of the Ship, and that notwithſtanding the Captain of the Ship had a particular grudg againſt the man of note in the other Ship, and was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at firſt to play the <hi>Eſau</hi> with this <hi>Jacob;</hi> but yet did him no harm.</p>
                     <p>5. To render His Wiſdom and Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and that not only to perſons the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſubjects of ſuch relief, but likewiſe to others in after-generations. So for the Wiſdom and Power of God; there was more than a few drops of theſe at the Red-ſea: how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is that deliverance taken notice of, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the Sacred Scriptures! The like may be ſaid of the diſtreſs of the Lord's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Eſther</hi>'s days: What a glorious diſplay was there of Power and Wiſdom in that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing deliverance! In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the low and diſtreſſed caſe of perſons there: for the title of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is, <hi>A prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed and poureth out his complaint before the Lord:</hi> And paſſages in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> do imply diſtreſſes: We have there doleful complaints, and a tragical deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſtreſs; expreſs mention made of <hi>Zion's</hi> ſtones, and duſt: and now, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſore diſtreſs of the Lord's people,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:101303:215"/> the Lord is not wanting; for it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>When the Lord will build up Zion, he will appear in his glory;</hi> that is, he will exalt the glory of his Attributes, particularly, of his Power and Wiſdom; he hath both Power and Skill to gather the ſtones and duſt, and make a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous building, glorious to the eyes of thoſe who ſhall take a view of all; <hi>for this ſhall be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the generation to come; and the people which ſhall be created ſhall praiſe the Lord,</hi> ver. 18.</p>
                     <p>6. To check the pride, inſultation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious reſolutions of wicked ones. <hi>Come,</hi> ſay the <hi>Babylonians, ſing us one of the ſongs of Zion,</hi> Pſal. 137. 3. God can in time let the <hi>Babylonian</hi> know, there are thoſe whom he can make uſe of to make the <hi>Babylonians</hi> howl, who now call for ſinging one of the Lord's ſongs. How were <hi>Pharaoh, Haman, Senacherih,</hi> check't at a nick of time! And not only in former times hath <hi>Providence</hi> been ſeen in giving a check, but alſo in later days. There is a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtory of <hi>Magdeburge,</hi> the Citizens whereof in <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's time, Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> ſtood out heroically, notwithſtanding the Emperor had born down with force the Proteſtants in all <hi>Germany;</hi> only <hi>Magdeburge</hi> is like the Pelican in the wilderneſs, and the Owl of the deſart, and the Sparrow alone on the houſe-top: and though ſo, yet how in the nick of time was Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who beſieged them, wheeled about to be their friend, and ſo makes Articles of Peace with them, and with his Army falls in upon the Emperor, who flies
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:101303:215"/> before him, and after forſakes the Imperial Crown, betaking himſelf to a retired life, and ſo the Proteſtant Intereſt which was ſore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, hath its reſurrection to the baffling of Popiſh expectations. Hither, or under this head, may be referred that of the witneſſes in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. I wave debates as to parties ſlain, and the time when, whether at ſeveral times in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral generations: That which makes for the matter in hand, is the Lord's raiſing them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their being ſlain, and that to the ſhame and terror of their adverſaries: for ſo in <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>After three days and an half, the Spirit of life from God entred into them, and they ſtood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them which ſaw them.</hi> That in <hi>Mie.</hi> 7. 10. may here be accommodated as a good Comment on this place, and pertinent to the matter in hand: <hi>Then ſhe that is mine enemy ſhall ſee it, and ſhame ſhall cover her which ſaid unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? Behold, mine eyes ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her; now ſhall ſhe be trodden down as the mire of the ſtreets.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To mention no more: The Lord doth ſtep in, in the depth of miſery, to endear himſelf unto perſons holpen; and to engage their hearts the more unto him, who doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his mercy at ſuch a ſeaſon. So in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>Thou in mercy haſt led forth the people which thou haſt redeemed.</hi> And Pſal. 34 6. <hi>This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his troubles.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal</hi> 116. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me; I found trouble and ſorrow: then I</hi>

                     <p>1. SEE folly and vanity, (1.) In regard of impatiency under evils. (2.) In regard of excurſions, or ſteppings aſide from duty to the uſe of means, for which men have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. There is folly both theſe ways. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> fell foul on <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe the door for egreſs out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was not opened at firſt knocking. What though a double Lock ſeem to be ſet on the door of the great work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe; yet no reaſon to quarrel; the Lord knows how and when to open the door, or break it open, as he did in his own time, to his own glory. It was <hi>Saul</hi>'s fault, that he would ſacrifice before <hi>Samuel</hi> came, and he ſmarted for it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 8, 9. Let men learn from <hi>Saul</hi>'s folly to be wiſe; let them not force themſelves to this or that as a means for help under ſtraits, which God approveth not; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring withal, how a <hi>Samuel</hi> may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with help from the Lord, when they are going from the Lord.</p>
                     <p>2. Watch againſt anxious and perplexing diſquiet of heart under ſtraits. There is no ground for a Chriſtian to diſtract his heart in the want of viſible means, or to diſtruſt his
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:101303:216"/> God in the midſt of viſible dangers. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who bids, to take no thought; that is, not to be anxious, diſtruſtful, diſquieted under difficulties; and withal, what he ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour,</hi> Matth. 10. 19. Not only Years, Months, Weeks, Days, but even Hours, for Heaven's help, are contained in the Calendar of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Treaſure up the Experiences of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Help under Needs and Difficulties. <hi>David</hi> had a ſignal appearance of <hi>Providence</hi> for his relief, when <hi>Saul</hi> is on the one ſide of the Mountain, and <hi>David</hi> on the other: and this <hi>David</hi> forgets not; for it is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contained in his deliverance out of the hand of <hi>Saul;</hi> which deliverance he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. If thou haſt a Mountain-Providence, with <hi>David,</hi> forget not the God of thy Mountain-Diſpenſation. Remember two things: (1.) The more eminent thy Mercy, the more reaſon to value it. The depth of a Miſery may well call for the admiration of the height of Divine Mercy: ſee an inſtance <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. (2) The laying up of ſuch an Experience, will be of great uſe for after-times. Thou mayeſt be in regard of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals or ſpirituals, as is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 20. Now when neither Sun nor Starrs in many days ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, &amp;c.

                     <p>HOW the <hi>Providence</hi> of God is diſplayed both as to Time and Place, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as to the ſo timing of Help under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, hath been inſiſted on. The preſent Obſervation, which hath ſome reference both to Time and Place, is now to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto: And here, in the firſt place, ſhall be ſhewed, how the like work of <hi>Providence</hi> in Places may be conſideredi and that three ways:</p>
                     <p>1. In regard of Premonition or diſcovery of what is to take place in the world. Thus when the Lord would take up <hi>Elijah</hi> into Heaven, not only <hi>Eliſha</hi> hath a diſcovery of what the Lord is about to do; but the ſons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were at <hi>Bethel,</hi> 2 King. 2. 3. and not only they, but alſo the ſons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were at <hi>Jericho,</hi> v. 5. <hi>of the ſame chapter.</hi> And ſo the hand of the Lord was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the evening, afore one that had eſcaped from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> brought tydings that the City was ſmitten, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 21, 22. <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:101303:217"/> at <hi>Joppa</hi> hath a Viſion which holds correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with a work of <hi>Providence</hi> referring to the Gentiles, particularly, <hi>Cornelius</hi> at <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> who was bid to ſend to <hi>Joppa,</hi> and call for one <hi>Simon,</hi> whoſe fir-name was <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>2. In regard of antecedent preparation, diſpoſition, or qualification, for what is to come forth on the ſtage of the World. The <hi>Jews</hi> were awakened to prayer-work, when the Seventy years were, or nigh, accompliſhed at <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jer. 29. 12. <hi>Moſes</hi> is to go on the Lord's Embaſſie to <hi>Egypt;</hi> he wants a Spokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and God brings one to his hand, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 10, 14, 15, 16, 27. When Chriſt was brought to the Temple, what a wonderful <hi>Providence</hi> was there in <hi>Simeon</hi>'s coming thither at that time when <hi>Mary</hi> came thither? and ſo in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s coming in that inſtant, as it is ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 27, 38? Both <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to and for Chriſt; they came ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Temple, there to teſtifie of Him who was Lord of the Temple. <hi>Ver.</hi> 29, to the 39.</p>
                     <p>3. In regard of the work it ſelf, which is the ſame, or a like, for kind. And here we may conſider it,
<list>
                           <item>1. As a Work of Mercy in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</item>
                           <item>2. As a Work of Wrath.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. As a Work of Mercy. The Goſpel of Grace was communicated to the Gentiles, and the gift of the Holy Ghoſt was poured out on
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:101303:218"/> them, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 45. They at <hi>Corinth</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched in utterance and knowledg, as well as they at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 5. In the times of the Reformation of Religion, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> at the ſame time oppoſeth the Pope's Indulgences amongſt the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> at which <hi>Luther</hi> did amongſt the <hi>Germans:</hi> how did then Cities, Towns, Pariſhes, fall off from Popery, as leaves from the Trees in <hi>Autumn?</hi> And ſo it is obſerved how Learning at one and the ſame time began to hold up its head, and that in divers places, as <hi>Scultetus</hi> hath it. And as for Learning, ſo for Peace and Tranquillity, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God may be noted. It is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt thorowout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria.</hi> A time there is, when Countreys have their worldly Jubilee. All the earth ſitteth ſtill, and is at reſt, is the report made, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 11.<note place="margin">Docebat hoc tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore in Tiguri Helvetiis Ulricus <hi>Zuinglius</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sleid.</hi> com. lib. 1 ſub fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem—Et quod mireris uno &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore in diverſis mundi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionibus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortua pridem ſtudia in Vitam revocabant <hi>Leo</hi> 10.

                     </p>
                     <p>2. As a Work of Wrath, or Severity; and ſo there may be noted how a like face of things there is in places at or nigh the ſame time. A time there was, when the Lord ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own ways, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 16. A time there was, when ignorance, and lack of learning did prevail to an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ſtupidity of thoſe in that time.

                     <p>1. BEHOLD how the Lord is God in one place as well as another. He is not confined in regard of operations to this or that Countrey or Kingdom. It's ſaid in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 6. Every one (of the living creatures) had four faces, and every one had four wings; their four faces behold the four quarters of the world; and their four wings may note their being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh't for action in divers places; and take their flight at one and the ſame time, to bring about what the Lord commiſſions to be done.</p>
                     <p>2. No reaſon for perſons to be deſpondent who want Mercies of which others in other places are participant of. The ſame Sun of like favours may ſhine upon their habitation. Were perſons more prayerful, they might have experience of God's being merciful. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware we then of a diſcontented eye at others Mercies, and wiſely improve our own wants. There is enough in the rich Exchequer of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> to ſupply all wants, whether for ſoul or for the outward man. <hi>Providence</hi> knows how to comfort the waſte places, to make the Wilderneſs like <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Deſart like the Garden of the Lord, <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1. From God's otherwiſe informing the judgments of perſons about matters. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was without iſſue, heir-male and female. He thought <hi>Eliezer</hi> muſt be the man who muſt heir it.

                     <p>3. From aſſertions in Scripture which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo much. <hi>I returned, and ſaw under the ſun, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to men of skill; but time and chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to them all,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 11.

                     <p>4. From exemplifications, and that in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals and ſpirituals.

                     <p>1. THERE is no ground then for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory concluſions from a probable face of things. How quickly may the Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball melt? the great bubble vaniſh? the ſtorm turn into a calm, and the calm into a ſtorm? The Diſciples were much taken with the Buildings of the Temple; and what faith Chriſt? <hi>See ye not all theſe things? Verily I ſay unto you, there ſhall not be left here one ſtone upon another, that ſhall not be thrown down,</hi> Mat. 24. 1, 2. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 2. it was told the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Syria is confederate with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim: and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</hi> But yet all this promiſing, or rather threatning, confederacy, ends in ſmoak; there is a daſhing-work of <hi>Providence,</hi> as is fully there deſcribed from <hi>v.</hi> 3, to 10.</p>
                     <p>2. Beware of raſhneſs in acting upon a face of things which preſents it ſelf. Many
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:101303:221"/> pay deer in their Credits, Purſes, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, by taking an alarum, when they might have ſlept quiet in the bed of an holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and confidence in God. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, the holy one of Iſrael, In returning and reſt ſhall ye be ſaved, in quietneſs and confidence ſhall be your ſtrength, and ye would not: but ye ſaid no; for we will flie upon hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; therefore ſhall ye flee: and we will ride upon the ſwift; therefore ſhall they that purſue you be ſwift,</hi> Iſa. 30. 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>3. Quarrel not with the Lord's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, becauſe he doth thus make and unmake; build, as it were, an houſe, and by and by pulls it down. If the bringing forth of ſome things is like the ſhooting up of <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> quickly up, and quickly down; yet ſure the <hi>Providence</hi> of God reacheth to theſe <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> as well as to the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> There is no reaſon for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1. To let men know how the Lord he is God; for things go according to his thoughts, and not as men ſurmiſe and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, according to the outward appearance of things. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>how great are thy works, and thy thoughts very deep?

                           </gap>y thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord: for as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 15. 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>2. To diſplay his Soveraignty more or leſs as he pleaſeth. What if the Lord ſhall daſh veſſels made? ſhake off the fruit ere it be ripe, as in abortive Infants? Is He therefore to be quarrelled with? May not he break the veſſels, as Jer. 18. 6? <hi>O houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you as this potter, ſaith the Lord?</hi> and ſay to the Fig-tree, <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever,</hi> Mat. 21. 19.</p>
                     <p>3. To bring to light the ſins of men by a probable face of things. <hi>Shimei</hi> diſcovers his rooted venom in the fruits of it, when <hi>David</hi> was made at by <hi>Abſolom, Achitophel,</hi> and their followers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. If there be a likelihood of this or that Error to have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and profit annexed to it, though it be a very groſs or palpable one, yea, though a heap of them; what villany doth appear on the deck, which before lay cloſe under the hatches of the ſhip? What coining of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, which the great Maſter of the Mint will cenſure as falſe and felonious to the Crown of Heaven? The Lord then is
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:101303:222"/> wiſe in ſetting up ſuch Pumps, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ply'd, throw forth black and ſlimy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>4. To exerciſe the graces of perſons; for the graces of Saints may be both proved and improved by a probable face of things. So it was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his faith, fear, obedience, were diſplayed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>5. To puniſh men for their ſins. Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in matters make way for vindictive Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> from a Probability, is intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the Lord's Net in the Red-ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 3. The red waters become bloody ones to the <hi>Moabites,</hi> whoſe wrong concluſion from probable Premiſes, proved a bloody one, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 22, 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>6. To teach men conſtant dependance on God. Men point, and God diſappoints. They propoſe, but God diſpoſeth. The wind of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is variable, and therefore men had need eye God in the voyage—It is not ſo ſoon done as ſaid: <hi>We will go into ſuch a City, and continue there a year, and buy, and ſell, and get gain:</hi> See <hi>James</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To leſſon thankfulneſs for a diſplay of Mercy in daſhing-things likely to take place. A Copy of Conveyance is cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a freſh one is drawn by the hand of <hi>Providence</hi> for the good of the party. <hi>Ruth</hi>'s marriage with the Kinſman was daſh't; and well for her, whom <hi>Providence</hi> had intended for a more ingenuous and pious man. What
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:101303:223"/> is daſh't, holds in many caſes for the beſt God hath regard to his, when he ſeemeth to have none. He dams up a Well, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a better Spring for them. Their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beſt ſucceeds, when it is ſometimes quite daſh't. As there are bleſſed diſappointments, ſo there is ground to bleſs God for ſuch diſappointments, which come from the Heart as well as the hand of gracious <hi>Providence.</hi>

                     <p>AS there is a daſhing-work of <hi>Providence,</hi> as hath before been ſhewed; ſo there is an Accompliſhing-work in regard of what the Lord wills or willingly ſuffers to be in the world.

<list>
                           <item>1. The Power of God.</item>
                           <item>2. The Wiſdom of God.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>1. Nothing is too hard for Infinite Power to bring about. The greateſt blocks in the way, like a feather, are blown away with the breath of <hi>Providence.</hi> All letts, like the thin film of Ice, ſhall be diſſolved by the warm Sun-beams of Providential Influences. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had lien long in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:101303:224"/> it was too hot a work for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pluck them thence by the hand of violence, that was not the Lord's way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them; and yet the Lord ſaved the people out of the Land of <hi>Egypt, Jude</hi> ver. 5. The <hi>Jews</hi> met with oppoſers in the Temple-work; it is ſaid, how upon an Order from <hi>Artaxerxes, Rehum</hi> and <hi>Shimſhai,</hi> with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, made them to ceaſe by force and power, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 23. and yet this work, which lay dormant for ſome years, was finiſh't at laſt; ſee <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 24. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 15. <hi>John</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                     <p>2. God, according to his Infinite Wiſdom, hath ways to bring about matters in his own time, notwithſtanding hindrances and delays for a time. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 5. the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> took the Ark of God: they have it, but muſt not hold it; it muſt be had home again; and how ſhall this be? Let the Lord alone; who can find out a way for its conveyance, though it be in the Countrey of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> ſeven months, as it is related, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 1. Suppoſe thoſe Fifty thouſand three-ſcore and ten men who were ſlain upon the return of the Ark, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19. had been ſlain in battel in order to the reſcue of the Ark; yet the ſame way God took to bring it home, would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, though the difficulty of having it home had been greater in the eyes of the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who in this caſe had fought to no purpoſe. And what is ſaid in this caſe of the Ark, holds in other matters. Our Cock-ſhell Capacity is not receptive of the Ocean of
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:101303:224"/> Divine Wiſdom. Let this Sun ariſe, and it ſcatters the clouds and miſts that are in our eye. A thouſand ways infinite Wiſdom hath to effect matters, though we ſee never an one.</p>

                     <p>1. SEE the reaſon why there is dejection and deſpondency. Men have both their eyes fixed on Hindrances and Delays, and not half an one open to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. Whilſt <hi>David</hi> pores on <hi>Saul</hi>'s Power, Subtilty, and Fury, no wonder if <hi>David</hi> be not <hi>David</hi> in point of the exerciſe of Faith, Patience, Hope; but ſay, <hi>I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul.</hi> Chriſtians, in caſes of this nature, are like the man who looks on the wheel turning, but not on the Flye on the Wheel creeping in a contrary motion to the Wheel. The Flye of <hi>Providence</hi> is on its motion, whilſt the Wheel of Second Cauſes have their contrary motion, as may be ſhewed in another diſtinct following Obſervation. As in a ſhip ſailing directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a man walks from the Fore-caſtle or Stem of the ſhip, towards the Stern; yet he that ſhall conclude the motion of the ſhip to be the ſame, will conclude amiſs. The ſhip of <hi>Providence</hi> is ſetting forward towards its Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though Second-Cauſes are walking in a contrary motion on the Deck. Let <hi>Providence</hi>
                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:101303:225"/> then alone to play the Pilot, and do thou in the interim pray for a good voyage.</p>
                     <p>2. There is good reaſon to bear up, though the burden be heavy, and have lien long on the ſhoulder, and none to take it off.</p>
                     <p>1. Is the Plea, That the burden is heavy? Conſider, you may have experience of God's kindneſs; and the ſooner have it, by how much more it becomes heavy. The more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you are, the more God may ſtrengthen in the way, and bring you to your journey's end with joy. Remember <hi>Paul</hi>'s caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>2. Is the Plea, That the burden hath lien long on the Conſcience, Credit, State, Body, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Conſider, (1.) This is no new caſe: <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, David,</hi> with others of God's Saints, can tell ſtories of difficulties, and long-ſpun forth ones. (2.) The queſtion is, Who is more a Waiter? you, that you may have a Mercy; or God, that you may be fitted for a Mercy? The Lord waits that he may be gracious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18. (3.) The Hand of the Clock hath its motion in the dark night, though a man ſee it not. There was a Ram inſtead of <hi>Iſaac</hi> in yonder buſh, when <hi>Abraham</hi> might not ſee it at its firſt inſtant, being caught there. 4. Though the burden continue longer, yet wait longer; for ſo it becometh to do, as others have done, and thou art taught to do, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 8. with 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>3. Is the Plea, That there is none to help, Means, Inſtruments, fail: Conſider,</p>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:101303:225"/>
                     <p>1. Though the Arm of fleſh wither, yet the Hand of <hi>Providence</hi> ſtill flouriſheth. God is God without Means and Inſtruments, as well as with them. His Arm can then bring ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when there is none to help, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 5.</p>
                     <p>2. Help by Means, Inſtruments, fails in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to help. The way to have help, is to be mortified to Creature-helps. God will lead men to ſee that in himſelf, which after he may communicate by ordinary Means. Eye then God more, and Men leſs, and thou mayſt find, how <hi>Providence</hi> is then on its March, when the Drums ſound nothing but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to Senſe and Reaſon.</p>

                        <pb n="437" facs="tcp:101303:226"/> reſpect both Temporals and Spirituals. Men whilſt they mind one matter in their Civil concernments, fall in upon another; as he who diggeth his garden-plot findeth a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeketh his father's Aſſes, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. <hi>David</hi> is ſent by his father to the Camp with proviſion for his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and there killeth <hi>Goliah,</hi> and ſo founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was laid for after-matters, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. And as in Temporals this may be noted; ſo in matters of Soul-concernment. Whilſt men mind Earth, they meet with Heaven. Some go abroad to ſeek a ſervice, and are by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of God caſt there, where they come to be-think themſelves of another kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, namely, the Service of the great God, whom before they look't not after—It's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſome of thoſe many Nations, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. be-took themſelves to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon a Secular account. However they were, by an occaſion offered, drawn to be hearers of the Apoſtles, <hi>v</hi> 6. Whatever their End were in hearing, God's <hi>Providence</hi> was wonderful in the Apoſtle's ſpeaking; for there was added to the Church about three thouſand ſouls, <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> were caſting their Net into the Sea, and Chriſt ſaith then and there to them, <hi>Follow me, and I will make you fiſhers of men,</hi> Mat. 4. 18, 19. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were mending their nets, and Chriſt in like ſort meets with them when his walk was by the ſea of <hi>Galilee, ver.</hi> 18, 21, 22. The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> cometh to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well to draw water: She minded water to ſet over the pot, or waſh her diſhes,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:101303:227"/> or the like; little thought ſhe of another kind of water which Chriſt the Fountain of life did there diſcourſe of, and hand to her, <hi>John</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In regard of the Inducement by which men are moved; and this may be conſidered, (1.) As ſtarted in their own breaſts. (2.) As ſuggeſted by others with whom they have to do; for ſo we find how <hi>Saul</hi> was influenced on by his Father's ſervant to go to <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Naaman</hi> hears of the Prophet, who bid him waſh and be clean, from the little Captive-maid in his Family, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 2, 3. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> is induced by <hi>Philip</hi> to come to Chriſt, who tells him a ſtory of the Fig-tree, which he little thought to have heard of, <hi>John</hi> 1. 45, 46, 47, 48.</p>
                     <p>Now what may induce or draw on a man to what he doth not ſo experiment as after, may be further conſidered:</p>
                     <p>1. Sometimes a luſt by an over-ruling <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> ſhall contribute to what is ſubſequent, <hi>Oneſimus</hi> runs away from his Maſter, gets to <hi>Rome,</hi> a populous City, where in probability he might lie hid; <hi>Paul</hi> is there, who by <hi>Providence</hi> lights on him, and ſends him home a Convert to his Maſter <hi>Philemon. Paul</hi> before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in a mad fit rambles as far as <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> where was an <hi>Ananias</hi> for him with a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; Chriſt having met with <hi>Paul</hi> by the way, and let out the mad blood, which filled every vein before.</p>
                     <p>2. Sometimes men's civil buſineſs or affairs, is an inlet to other matters, as was before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:101303:227"/> in the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>'s coming to the Well—So when the Jaylor was troubled about his Priſoners, then was the Lord's time to let him ſee what a ſlave he was to Satan, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 27, 28, 29.</p>
                     <p>3. Sometimes the obſerving of a <hi>Providence</hi> in way of conviction, may lead on to further matters, as in <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his caſe, <hi>John</hi> 3. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Sometimes ſome ſtrong impulſe upon the heart ſways. So likely it was in the <hi>Shunamite</hi>-woman; go ſhe muſt to the Prophet, who rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her ſon for her from the dead, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 22, 23. It is ſaid of Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> how he could not be quiet, but muſt at night away to a man's houſe, where coming, the man was about to deſtroy himſelf, and ſo a ſtop was put to the Tragedy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In regard of the Iſſue, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, (1.) What is ſeen. (2.) What is not ſeen till afterwards. Now the iſſue of what is ſeen, may be conſidered, (1.) As ſucceſleſs. <hi>Saul</hi> ſought the Countrey for the Aſſes, but found them not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 4. after he was told of them by <hi>Samuel,</hi> but he goes home without them. They who came to apprehend Chriſt, were led to a conviction, but apprehend him not, <hi>John</hi> 7. 45, 46. (2.) As ſuccesful; and that in regard of what was intended. <hi>Naaman</hi> comes for a cure, and hath it; <hi>his fleſh came again like unto the fleſh of a little child; and he was clean,</hi> 2 Kings 5. 14.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, The iſſue of what is not ſeen, may be conſidered, (1.) Purely. (2.) Mixtly.
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:101303:228"/> If we conſider it purely or ſingly; and ſo ſmart or puniſhment is the iſſue of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, though men imagine no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The <hi>Philiſtins</hi> are for keeping holy-day to their <hi>Dagon; Sampſon</hi> is called for to make them ſport; and their Houſe of Mirth becomes the Houſe of Mourning, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. Again, Favour or Mercy may be the iſſue. So <hi>Naaman,</hi> he went home wiſer for Heaven than he came. <hi>Matthew</hi> was ſitting at the Receit of Cuſtom, and there Chriſt calls him, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 27. Who would have thought, that the Publican going to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe, or ſome ſtanding in the Market, ſhould be called to be one of the Caſh-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven's Treaſure, or a Pay-maſter of better Riches abroad in the World. The iſſue in a way of mercy was wonderful. And as the iſſue is ſingly conſidered by way of frown or ſmile; ſo ſometimes it is Mixt. There is both Vinegar and Honey in it. <hi>Joſeph</hi> his brethren were both afflicted and comforted in their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> journey for Corn for their Families. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> hands Gold out of the Mine, and withal ſome ſcaring-guſhes of Water may affright them who labour in the Mine of this or that buſineſs of concernment.</p>

                     <p>2. Learn, how God is holy and righteous in the ordering of things, notwithſtanding the intervention of men's ſins before things are brought about. Whilſt men mind their own work, they forward Heaven's deſign. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> can behold a holy, wiſe, good God, in his Chain; albeit ſome of the links thereof were very crooked, and had a great deal of ruſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20.</p>
                     <p>3. See how the Enemies of the Church are outwitted in their deſigns againſt the Church: they are led by what they do ſee, and miſ-led to their ruin. They whet the knife which cuts their own throat; they are gathered together againſt <hi>Zion,</hi> and yet the Lord gathers them as ſheaves to be threſhed in the floor: they

                     <p>1. In matters of Perſonal Concernment: Thus a man's own ſins (and yet no thank to ſin) are a foundation for his humility, and ground for an holy watchfulneſs. A Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an riſeth by his fall. <hi>Peter</hi> after his denial of his Maſter, is modeſt in his profeſſion of his love to Chriſt: ſee <hi>John</hi> 21. 15. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 33, 35. And as ſin is an hindrance to ſpiritual good (and yet the Lord orders all for good): ſo Satan means no good to a child of God. The Devil is the great Blood-ſucker, yet is Heaven's Leech. <hi>Providence</hi> knows how to uſe him to the glory of <hi>Providence.</hi> That Foe of the Chriſtian ſhall become in a ſort the Chriſtian's Friend: thus profeſſeth the

                     <p>1. The Mountains of Oppoſition become Plains, according to that in <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Power and Authority there intended, ſhall no longer mountain it againſt the Church, but countenance the afflicted.

                        </note> correſpondency of <hi>Providence</hi> in after-times, with foregoing-times, may be noted. It is left on record, how the Popes Bull, and the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Edict of the Emperor in <hi>Luther</hi>'s days, did rather encourage to, than diſcourage from, a cloſure with the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>2. As for Errors and Hereſies with which the Church of God is often peſtered: Theſe are an occaſion, whereby the Truths of God <note place="margin">Ita nihil obſiſtere divinae gratiae poteſt, quo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus id quod vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatur, dum eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae ad unitatem trahunt, &amp; plagae in remedium vertuntur, ut Eccleſia unde metuit periculum, inde ſumat augmentum. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ.</hi> lib. 2. de Vocat.

It is conceived by ſome, The occaſion of <hi>John</hi> his writing the Goſpel, was the Errors broached by <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who did play the Devils with the God-head of Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Pen walks to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> when Diſorders and Error in that point of the Reſurrection, had an unhappy riſe there.

                        <hi>be alſo Hereſies among you, that they which are approved, may be made manifeſt among you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 9. Truth and Godlineſs, like a Torch, burn the brighter being thus beaten. We had not had ſuch deep ſearches into Truths, had not the Spirit of Error poſſeſt the heads of men. Scarce an Error but hath had ſome Treatiſe or other written againſt it.</p>
                     <p>3. Apoſtaſies from the Church of Chriſt are matter of lamentation; yet the Lord knows how to render theſe as uſeful to others for their encouragement and confirmation in the ways of God. God's Judgments on Apoſtates are a Beacon ſet on fire to warn others.

                     <p>2. In Temporals, Hindrances become Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances. Inſtances there are in divers caſes: As,</p>
                     <p>1. In Marriage: ſo a likely progreſs was made in <hi>Ruth</hi>'s diſpoſal to the Kinſman; <hi>Boaz</hi> tells of him, and promiſeth he will ſee what will be done, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 13, 18. and accordingly <hi>Boaz</hi> convenes the man (who providentially came by) before the Elders of the City; the buſineſs of the Purchaſe is broke to him, and by and by all is broke to pieces; howbeit this hindrance is a furtherance of marriage with a better man, even <hi>Boaz</hi> himſelf, as we have the ſtory in the fourth Chapter of <hi>Ruth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. In impoveriſhments or loſſes: Men may be the better fitted for proſperity, by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied adverſity. The Lord who makes poor to a wonder, can make rich to a miracle. The Lord bleſſed the latter end of <hi>Job</hi> more than the beginning, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 12.</p>
                     <p>3. In Sickneſs, which may make way for further Health, as God is pleaſed to order it, and ſanctifie his Diſpenſation. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> dies not, but hath a leaſe of fifteen years added to his life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 5. An improved ſickneſs may both phyſically and morally conduce to health. A man learns in part to be his own Phyſician, and to glorifie God more with his health, than formerly.</p>
                     <p>4. In Debaſements and Reproaches: <hi>Joſeph</hi>
                        <pb n="448" facs="tcp:101303:232"/> is advanced, and that by them who in their actings intended his utter downfall. The ſold Slave becomes a Prince in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs her defamation might after make for his reputation. Falſe aſperſions do oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the glory of the aſperſed, and the infamy of the aſperſers. <hi>The lip of truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment,</hi> Prov. 12. 19.</p>
                     <p>5. In Defeats of Arms. It is noted in the Life of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> That what did fall out as probable letts, did prove a furtherance for a Victory. The loſs of a battel is ſometimes a preface to a compleat conqueſt. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are ſmitten by the men of <hi>Ai, Joſh.</hi> 7. 5. and their being ſmitten, is an inducement to the men of <hi>Ai</hi> to be more forward than wiſe in the management of their next battel, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8. 16, 17. It is then an experienced Obſervation, That ſome loſe by their Victories, and others gain by their Defeats.</p>
                     <p>6. In Journeys. <hi>Jacob</hi> was to return to his Countrey: there was an <hi>Eſau</hi> in the way; he comes forth with Four hundred men; and well for <hi>Jacob</hi> that the wild Ruffians were under the command of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who hurts him not. A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rendezvouz might be preventive of plundering and butchering ſtraglers: ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. and 33.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. THERE is no reaſon to be peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in concluding a nullity of matters, becauſe of ſome interponent hindrances. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and Deſpondency do too often make a riot in the Soul. God's word is queſtioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are great blocks in the way of his Promiſe. Men look more to the blocks, than to God, who can remove them; yea, ſo play the Sacred Carpenter with them, as to make an hepping-ſtock of them for an aſcent to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours intended. What though the Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be not only ſingle, but complicated ones? Yet is any thing too hard for the Lord? And ſhould it be too hard for our Faith? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom, it is ſaid, That <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not weak in faith, he conſidered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old; neither yet the deadneſs of Sarah's womb: he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4. 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>2. Beware of an irregular anger and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of heart, when ſome hindrance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſteps in. If perſons had more of patience, they might be ſenſible, how what falls in, falls out for good. The hindrance may be further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</p>
                     <p>1. In regard of the thing individually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; That matter in particular may take place. In God's time, <hi>Joſeph</hi> hath ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement as the dreams did foretel; and that
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:101303:233"/> notwithſtanding all eſſays to the contrary by the diſcontented brethren. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be the man by whom God delivers <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſought to ſlay him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                     <p>2. In regard of the thing under that kind conſidered. The marriage of <hi>Ruth</hi> with the Kinſman is daſh't; yet that makes way for a better marriage.</p>
                     <p>3. In regard of the thing more generally conſidered; Equivalently, if not ſuperahun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, an hindrance becomes a furtherance of good another way. The hindrance in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs may prove a furtherance in Spirituals; or, the hindrance in leſſer matters of temporal concernment, may be a furtherance in what is of greater conſequence; namely, as to Life it ſelf. I find an illuſtration for this in <hi>Mory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Itinerary (Part 1. Book 1. Chap. 5.); and perſons may do well to accommodate the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in other caſes. The ſtory, as that ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentleman relates it, is thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That at what time a fair wind ariſing, all the Ships gladly weighed Anchor; the Anchor of our Ship brake; ſo as our Conſorts (ſeven other little Ships) went on: but our Maſter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Naval Diſcipline, not to put to Sea with one Anchor, returned back to the Harbour of the <hi>Fly,</hi> there to buy a new An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; all of us curſing fooliſhly our Fortune, and the Starrs. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning, while we ſadly walked on the ſhore, we might ſee our Conſorts coming back with torn ſails, and dead men, and quarters of men, lying on the Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for they had met with two <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi>
                        <pb n="351" facs="tcp:101303:233"/> who had taken them, and ſpoiled their Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hereupon he ſaith thus: As we had juſt cauſe to praiſe the Almighty, who had thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us out of the jaws of death; ſo had we much more cauſe to bewail our raſhneſs, yea, and our wickedneſs, that we had ſtriven, yea, and repined againſt his Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which with humble and hearty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I confeſs, to the glory of his Sacred Name.</p>
                     <p>3. Take a view of the rich diſplay of the Divine Attributes in the exchange of Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances into Furtherances. More particularly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>1. The Power of God. A potent Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance ſtoops to Him who is Omnipotent. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a very great block in the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> way or paſſage out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet the Lord with one blow ſtruck at the firſt-born, opens a paſſage for <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 12. 31.</p>
                     <p>2. The Wiſdom of God, which is ſeen ſometimes in the quality of the Hindrance, which doth well accord with the Waggon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſpanning the Wheel, whereby the ſteep deſcent is check't from being injurious. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, The Wiſdom of God is ſeen in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act timing of an Hindrance. <hi>David</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed by the Lords of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and all this at ſuch a point of time, as that <hi>David</hi> might behold the finger of God: As in bringing him off from going with <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>3. What need is there for men to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God in all their ways? For Furtherances pitched on, though free from obliquity, yet prove Hindrances ſometimes. Whilſt in an honeſt and prudent ſort ſome labour to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage affairs with others, inſtead of pleaſing, they do diſpleaſe. <hi>Luther</hi> found his mild <note place="margin">

                     <p>HOW the Lord brings about matters notwithſtanding letts; and turns Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances into Furtherances, and Furtherances into Hindrances, hath been ſhewed. A fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obſervation as to the manner of God's working, is here to be conſidered; and that with reſpect,</p>
                     <p>1. To Calamities, or wrathful Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>2. Mercies, or ſmiling Diſpenſations. And in each of theſe a gradual proceſs is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To begin then with the firſt; and that may be illuſtrated three ways:</p>
                     <p>1. From Metaphorical and Alluſive terms in Scriptures. Metaphors are contract Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes; and Scripture-Similitudes, in regard of their proper ſcope, do point out the truth of the thing, whilſt they paint it out. In <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſ.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the houſe of Judah rottenneſs.</hi> Both the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:101303:238"/> Moth and Worm do by degrees conſume the Garment and Tree, whoſe corroding Tenants they are. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. the Angels there have the vials of the wrath of God; theſe vials are poured forth not all at once, but gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and each vial may have its degrees too; for ſo the form of a vial imports: What is contained in a vial, is not poured forth as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of a Pail or Bucket, the brim whereof, in regard of its latitude, is commenſurate with its bottom.</p>
                     <p>2. From Exemplifications. Before <hi>Iſrael</hi> was carri'd away captive by <hi>Salmaneſer,</hi> 2 King. 17. they had not only warnings by the Prophets of the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 13. but alſo knocks, before the killing-blow by <hi>Salmeneſer.</hi> We read of their inteſtine broils, and forreign ones too, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. That of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is full; <hi>Iſrael is a ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſheep, the lions have driven him away: firſt the king of Aſſyria hath devoured him, and laſt this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones,</hi> Jer. 50. 17. And not only ſo of old, but in the Calamity fore-told by Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. there were doleful harbingers and fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the deſtruction of the Jewiſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a Jew, hath written a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on Chriſt's Prophecy. <hi>Gamaliel</hi> tells of two by-blows, and they bloody ones, which happened to their State, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 36, 37.</p>
                     <p>3. From the various wiſe ends of God; as, (1.) To teſtifie the patience and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God towards men. God doth not by and by fall in; he bears and forbears. There are Rods before Scorpions. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt</hi>
                        <pb n="462" facs="tcp:101303:239"/> 
                        <hi>ſinned from the days of Gibeah,</hi> Hoſ. 10. 9. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim! How ſhall I deliver thee, O Iſrael! How ſhall I make thee as Admah! How ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 8. The long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> while the Ark was a preparing, as is ſaid 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. (2.) To render men without excuſe, who notwithſtanding preambulatory Diſpenſations of <hi>Providence,</hi> are ſtill vile and impenitent. <hi>The people turneth not unto him that ſmiteth them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts: therefore will the Lord cut off from Iſrael head and tail, branch and ruſh in one day,</hi> Iſa. 9. 13, 14. See further, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>In the next place; There is a gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Providence</hi> in Mercies: And this appears three ways:</p>
                     <p>1. From Promiſes which do imply ſo much. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord thy God will put out thoſe nations before thee by little and little,</hi> Deut. 7. 22. And ſo in Hoſ. 2. 15. <hi>I will give her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. From Inſtances, and that in Temporals and Spirituals. (1.) In matters referring to this life, there is firſt the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear, to allude to that in <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 28. Riches are oftentimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in gradually. It is ſaid of <hi>Jacob, The man encreaſed exceedingly, and had much cattel, and maid-ſervants, and men-ſervants, and camels, and aſſes,</hi> Gen. 30. 43. <hi>Joſeph</hi> had two petty exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations before the great one. God did let him
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:101303:239"/> underſtand, that he who could exalt him in <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Family, and in the Priſon, could, when he pleaſed, give him favour in the ſight of others. It is noted how <hi>David</hi> waxed ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſtronger, and the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed weaker and weaker, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Abraham</hi> had firſt a promiſe of a child; after, <hi>Iſmael</hi> is born; after, an <hi>Iſaac;</hi> after, a poſterity like the Starrs for number. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſick unto death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 1. a promiſe he hath for health, <hi>v.</hi> 5. direction for the means, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and the means prove ſuccesful. (2.) In Spirituals, <hi>The kingdom of heaven</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is like to a grain of muſtard ſeed which a man took and ſowed in his field, which indeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds; but when it is grown up, it is the greateſt amongſt herbs, and becometh a tree, ſo that the birds of the air come and lodg in the branches thereof,</hi> Mat. 13. 31, 32. <hi>So mightily grew the word of God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,</hi> Acts 19. 20. I might here more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſhew the gradual proceſs of <hi>Providence</hi> in Spirituals: it ſhall ſuffice to point out the way, rather than travel on it. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the extent of this Obſervation:</p>
                     <p>1. In the converſion of man from the ſtate of nature to a ſtate of grace. There is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual procedure in nature, though not in time diſtinguiſhable: for as in the creation, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> Gen. 3. ſo in the ſpiritual creation God ſets up light in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. Moreover, before the reception of grace in the heart, there is much of <hi>Providence</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Spiritual Seeds-man, in the diſpoſal
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:101303:240"/> of perſons here and there in order to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God; in rouzing ſome by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive diſpenſations, and the like precurſory dealings of <hi>Providence.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p>2. In the mortification of ſin. The Apoſtle ſets forth this by Crucifixion, a lingring death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. We are willed by the ſame Apoſtle to <hi>mortifie the members which are upon earth,</hi> Col. 3. 5.</p>
                     <p>3. In growth of grace. The very term doth imply the thing. An Acorn is not by and by an Oak. The Muſtard-ſeed becomes a tree in time; and the ſmoaking Flax, a flame. We read of children, young men, and fathers, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 13. The Trees are not all of equal height and bigneſs in the Lord's <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4: In Victory over <hi>Satan.</hi> So in that laſt Scripture mentioned; that is ſaid there of young men, <hi>Ye have overcome the wicked one;</hi> which is not, at leaſt in like degree, applied to children; and they who are the young men in grace, are not ſo well vers'd in Satan's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, as the wiſe and ſage fathers in grace are. <hi>We are not ignorant of his devices,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 11. The ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks of brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or treading Satan under the <hi>Romans</hi> feet ſhortly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20.</p>
                     <p>5. And laſtly, In a perception, ſenſe, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual feeling of the love of God; and this may be conſidered with reſpect to two ſorts of perſons: (1.) The new Convert, who late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſlave to Satan, is made a free ſubject to Chriſt. The duſt of ſin raiſed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:101303:240"/> his heart, by the hand of his Spirit, ſo that it is not by and by legible. A ſenſe of the party's own vileneſs, makes him, or her, hang the head, till Chriſt revive by ſome paſſage or other, as he did that poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaying to her, <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace,</hi> Luke 7. 50. with 44. (2.) The old Saint, but now in a deſert. Chriſt for wiſe ends ſtands aloof from the Saint's dores. The Lord is a chaſtizing-Father, or trying-One; and no wonder if the Child be not quiet till the Father ſmile. Thus <hi>David,</hi> who had defiled his Conſcience by ſin, was not by and by ſetled. The holy Dove builds not the Neſt of Comfort amongſt Thorns and Nettles; theſe muſt down, ere Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations come from above. <hi>David</hi> cries out of broken bones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 8. he is an humble ſupplicant for the light of God's countenance, and the joy of ſalvation, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. and no wonder, for broken bones are not by and by healed, and the nigh-ſhipwrack't veſſel by and by rigg'd. <hi>Job</hi>'s quiet and comfort was handed in by degrees; God anſwereth him out of a Whirlwind, <hi>chap.</hi> 38. and after vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates him from the calumnies of his friends, accepts his performances, and turns his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, as it is declared in <hi>chap.</hi> 42.</p>
                     <p>3. From the wiſe Ends of God in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual proceſs of Mercies. What theſe are, may be touched.</p>
                     <p>1. To correct for ſin. The Chariot of <hi>Providence</hi> moves no faſter, becauſe men throw
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:101303:241"/> the logs of ſin in the way. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for men to complain that God is ſlow in delivering, when they are ſwift in ſinning. <hi>The hand of the Lord is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave, &amp;c. but your ſins have ſeparated between you and your God; and your ſins have hid his face from you,</hi> Iſa. 59. 1, 2. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Wilderneſs-ſins made the Wilderneſs-journey forty years, which might have been performed in forty days.</p>
                     <p>2. To exerciſe faith, prayer, patience, by this gradual proceſs. <hi>Jacob</hi> is a Wreſtler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a Prevailer. <hi>Hannah</hi> prays, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and waits, ere ſhe hath a <hi>Samuel.</hi> There is a connexion of Duties with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, though not a connexion of Merit on our part. If <hi>Providence</hi> give in Mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeking of them, there is ground to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Soveraign Mercy, no reaſon to neglect Duty for time to come.</p>
                     <p>3. To fit for Mercies. The Scabbard muſt be fitted for the Sword; otherwiſe the Sword, though it have a golden Hilt, will cut the Scabbard, or fall out of it, to the danger of him who girds it on. There is the ſtrong Wine of Mercies, which weak heads are not able to bear. It's hard for a man to go over the high golden Bridg of Mercies, and not be giddy-headed. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were not by and by fitted for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> nor <hi>Joſeph</hi> for <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Dignity, nor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for the Royal Diadem, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>4. To teach the leſſon of thankfulneſs. For, (1.) The gradual proceſs of <hi>Providence</hi> in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, doth lay forth the Mercy by piece-meal before the eye. God could have created the World in one day; but he took ſix, to the end men might take the fuller view of the glorious work of Creation. The ſame method in the work of <hi>Providence,</hi> ſerves to the like end. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> doth rehearſe the ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their journey, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. A Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is better viewed in its walk, than in its leap. (2.) God's beſtowing things gradually, doth inure to the exerciſe of the grace of Thankfulneſs. Every little of mercy doth deſervedly call forth the Lord's praiſes. The ſlaying of <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> was a preamble for further thankfulneſs to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 3. 1, 2. 3. The very laying of the foundation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was ground for the Prieſts and Levites praiſing and giving thanks unto the Lord, as is recorded <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 10, 11. (3.) H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>reby Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are taught how to value the full crop of Mercy. The Husbandman's joy in the Harveſt, tranſcends his joy for pleaſant ſhowers before the Harveſt. His waiting makes way for his prizing what he waits for. <hi>Behold the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,</hi> James 5. 7. <hi>Canaan</hi> after a long Wilderneſs-journey, is the more valued by the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi>

                     <p>1. FROM the gradual proceſs of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in Judgments, behold the folly and ſtupidity of ſinners. They are ſecure, though Judgments have had their real as well as verbal Preface. God hath ſhewed the Rod, and ſmitten with it, and yet they promiſe themſelves Golden Mountains, when they are aſcending deſolate ones, like <hi>Agag,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Surely the bitterneſs of death is paſt,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 33. It was ſaid of <hi>Ephraim, Strangers have devoured his ſtrength, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray-hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth it not,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 9. Oh how ſad is the caſe of ſtupid ſinners, who conſider not how leſſer Judgments are but par-boilings for greater ones!</p>
                     <p>2. From the gradual proceſs of <hi>Providence</hi> in Mercies, learn,</p>
                     <p>1. To obſerve the firſt foot-ſteps of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Men ſhould be as forward in their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as <hi>Providence</hi> is in operation. The way to ſee the great things of <hi>Providence,</hi> is, not to deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                     <p>2. To watch againſt Pride and Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, if a Mercy come not by and by. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his ſoul which is lifted up, is not upright in him; but the juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> Hab.

                     <p>3. To improve the firſt-fruits of Mercy.

                     <p>1. There is a ſudden change of the face of things in regard of a black and ruful face of things to take place: and this will appear, (1.) From the full and elegant ſimilitudes by
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:101303:243"/> which this ſudden change is painted forth in its genuine and proper colours. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 13. <hi>Therefore this iniquity ſhall be to you as a breach ready to fall, ſwelling out in a high wall, whoſe breaking cometh ſuddenly, at an inſtant.</hi> Other full and pregnant alluſions there are, as to the withering of the graſs when the ſpirit of the Lord bloweth on it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 7. the cutting off like the foam on the waters, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 7. the travel of a woman with child, whoſe pangs are ſudden as well as ſure, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 3. (2.) From Inſtances and Exemplifications. The old World had a new face, though a ſad and weeping one, and that in the ſpace of forty days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 17. The Sun was riſen upon the Earth, when <hi>Lot</hi> entred <hi>Zoar; then the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of heaven,</hi> as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 19 23. 24. There are ſeven years of Famine after ſeven years of Plenty in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 41, 29, 30. The houſe of the Lord, and the King's houſe, and all the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the houſes of the great men, are burnt with fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. 13. <hi>In a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhall the king of Iſrael be cut off,</hi> Hoſ. 10. 15. <hi>For in an hour ſo great riches is come to nought,</hi> Rev. 18 17.</p>
                     <p>2. There is a ſudden change in the face of things in regard of a pleaſant and ſmiling-face of things to take place. And this will appear,</p>
                     <p>1. From Predictions and Intimations on this wiſe in Scripture. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 8. <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing? Who hath ſeen ſuch things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or ſhall a nation be bork at once? For</hi>

If it ſhall be extended further; that phraſe of the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15. doth give us to underſtand what a ſudden and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious change the Lord can make in the World by way of addition to his Church. And as God can and will encreaſe the number of his people; ſo likewiſe decreaſe the number of their adverſaries: ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18 8. <hi>Therefore ſhall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine: and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire.</hi> Again,</p>
                     <p>2. From Inſtances or Exemplifications. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> becomes an embelliſh't Jewel, who a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before lay neglected in the Priſon-rubbiſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 14. <hi>Then Pharaoh ſent and called Joſeph, and they brought him haſtily out of the dungeon.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are no longer Scavengers and Drudges in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the Lord's time is come for their delivery; a ſudden change there is for their delivery, after ſome delays; the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were urgent upon the people, that they might ſend them out of the Land in haſte; for they ſaid <hi>We be all dead men,</hi> Exod. 12. 33.

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>VVHAT hath been before ſaid as touching the Lord's bringing about of matters, his way or manner in working, both gradually, and on a ſudden, is not to be underſtood, as if therefore the uſe of means were in vain on man's part; the preſent Obſervation is a check to ſuch a wrong Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And whereas here it is ſaid, <hi>The uſe of means is man's work:</hi> this is not ſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as to deny a work of <hi>Providence</hi> in the very uſe of the means; for there is a work of <hi>Providence</hi> in directing to the means, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating to uſe them. The meaning then is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to point out man's duty, and ſo to leave the reſult of matters to <hi>Providence.</hi> And that the uſe of means is thus incumbent on man, appeareth:</p>
                     <p>1. Man will otherwiſe be found a violater of the Lord's Command. <hi>Make thee an ark of Gopher-wood,</hi> ſaid God to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>4. <hi>Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, ſo did he,</hi> v. 22. <hi>Noah</hi> had been a tranſgreſſor,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:101303:246"/> had he neglected Ark-work, and expected preſervation without the uſe of means to be made conſcience of by him. The uſe of means is commanded both for the outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, in reſpect of temporals as well as ſpirituals; ſo teacheth the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>And that ye ſtudy to be quiet, and to do your own buſineſs, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you.</hi> And in Phil. 2. 12. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. It's an ill requital of the Lord's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that when he honours man to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in matters, this condeſcention of God is abuſed, ſlighted, and not eſteemed as it ought to be. The great God needeth not the choiſeſt Tool for any work. It is of his goodneſs, that as he works in his <hi>Providence</hi> for man; ſo by man, as an under-agent or inſtrument; <hi>for we are labourers together with God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 9. Inſtruments and Means are ſo far ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, as God is pleaſed in and by them to make a conveyance of good to perſons.</p>
                     <p>3. A man hath the more of quietneſs of heart in uſing the means, albeit God work ſome other way for help. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had the greater ground for calmneſs of ſpirit, having done his endeavour to check the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency: he took counſel with his Princes and mighty men, to ſtop the waters of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which were without the City; and they did help him, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 32. 3. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are not forced (it ſeems) to leave their ſiege by reaſon of this ſtratagem of Warr; God helps another way; <hi>the Lord ſent an angel, which out</hi>
                        <pb n="477" facs="tcp:101303:246"/> 
                        <hi>off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders, and captains, in the camp of the king of Aſſyria: ſo he returned with ſhame of face into his own land; and when he was come into the houſe of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels, ſlew him there with the ſword,</hi> v. 21.</p>
                     <p>4. It's a tempting of God to throw-by the uſe of what means are to be uſed. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they do not fling away their Swords; for then they might be ſaid to fight againſt God, in not fighting the Enemy. And when they had <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> for their poſſeſſion, they were to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Corn, and not expect Manna, for Manna ceaſed, and the old Corn of the Land ſupplies them the firſt year, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 12. When the Devil ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down,</hi> Mat. 4. 6. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> v. 7. It is Hell's Divinity, not what is taught in Chriſt's School, To run to Miracles when Means are to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, The <hi>iſſue of means is God's work.</hi> Four things are conſiderable:</p>
                     <p>1. It belongs to God as his Prerogative-Royal, to iſſue matters as he ſees fit. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God the Lord belong the iſſues from death,</hi> Pſal. 68. 20. <hi>The preparations of the heart in man, and the anſwer of the tongue, is from the Lord,</hi> Prov. 16. 1. <hi>The horſe is prepared againſt the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: but ſafety is of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21. 31.</p>
                     <p>2. Probable means take not, and improbable ones attain the End intended, as the Lord is
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:101303:247"/> pleaſed. <hi>Aſa</hi> his Colledg of Phyſicians cure him not, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 12. Some have by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable means been recovered of ſickneſs, when others, notwithſtanding vaſt expences, have ſlipt into their graves. It is obſervable, how an handful of men do ſometimes beat a vaſt Army: the Army of the <hi>Syrians</hi> came with a ſmall company of men, and the Lord delivered a very great Hoſt into their hand, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 24.</p>
                     <p>3. Means uſed for matters lye dormant, and take not, till God be pleaſed effectually to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in his <hi>Providence. Joſeph</hi> was not ſo fool-hardy as not to uſe means for his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>But think on me</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler) <hi>when it ſhall be well with thee; and ſhew kindneſs, I pray thee, unto me; and make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this houſe,</hi> Gen. 40. 14. <hi>Joſeph</hi> here doth his duty, yet did not the chief Butler remember <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but forgat him, <hi>v.</hi> 23. And though the Butler forgat <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet God remembers <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſends a dream into the King's head, a great noiſe there is at Court hereupon; and this noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens the Butler from his ſleepy forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>I remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my faults this day,</hi> Gen. 41. 9. and ſo the old key which lay a ruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is now ſcou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>4. Means uſed have ſometime a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary iſſue to what they are intended, or might in probability uſher in Chriſt's innocency, his reply to the charge about King-ſhip, <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. the diſtwaſive by <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 19. the

That means have a quite contrary iſſue, hath before been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in diſtinct Obſervations, how Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances become Hindrances, and Hindrances Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances; and there ore it may ſuffice here to touch on this as proof of the ſecond branch of the Aphoriſm here.

                     <p>1. SEE the error of thoſe, who more or leſs caſt off the uſe of means. There is a temptation this way; and a folly in cloſure with the temptation. The demonſtration of the folly may here be inſiſted on, and that two ways, beſides what hath been ſaid, and may be in next Head.</p>
                     <p>1. How repugnant is this to the dictates of common Reaſon. Reaſon dictates for the uſe, and the proportionable uſe of means in matters. The common <hi>Proverbs</hi> do evidence ſo much; as, <hi>we muſt not lie in the ditch, and cry God help. There is no ſailing over the ſea in an Egg-ſhell. To ſet the Fox to keep the Geeſe, is a wild courſe.</hi> There are the ſparklings of Reaſon in theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagies; and if there be not light enough from theſe ſparklings, go we to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. How contradictory is this courſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the parties own practiſes. There was one who had taken up a conceit, That if God would ſave him, he ſhould be ſaved; and if not, the uſe of all means were in vain. The party falls ſick, ſends for a Phyſician; who knowing the diſeaſe of the Patient's Mind, as well as the Diſeaſe of the Body, replies, That <hi>if God have a purpoſe to recover you, you ſhall be recovered; and if not, all my labour will be loſt:</hi> And ſo, in this Glaſs, gave the party a view of the ugly error he had taken up in regard of the diſuſe of means for the Soul. <hi>Virel</hi> rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">Relig. Chriſt: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. lib. 2. c. 2.</note> a ſtory of a certain Noble-man, who was on his march with a well-accoutred Army; and it hapned, that he led his Army by the houſe of a faithful Paſtor, well known before to this Noble-man: This honeſt man willeth him to look up to, and rely on God, to favour his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Expeditions: he, by and by, enters his plea about <hi>Divine Providence;</hi> as if he had ſaid, God had decreed all Events, and therefore the Decree of God could not be altered by his prayers. That good Paſtor replies, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you therefore, That you lay aſide the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Arms as unprofitable, for as much as the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:101303:248"/> ſſue of Warr hangs on the <hi>Providence</hi> of God; ſo that nothing can happen beſides what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by God. The Noble-man anſwereth, That Arms could not without raſhneſs be laid aſide by thoſe who betake themſelves to Warr, inaſmuch as they are the Inſtruments by which God is wont to give victory, to whom he ſees fit to give it—The ſame, ſaith that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, I can affirm of Prayer, by which God is wont to beſtow on us ſuch things as are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both for the uſe of this life, and for eternal ſalvation; and therefore it is no leſs raſhneſs to neglect that, under pretence of <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> whenas it is ſo often commended by God with innumerable Promiſes propounded to thoſe who frequently exerciſe themſelves therein: and the Son of God himſelf hath given us an example herein, from whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is commanded, <hi>that we pray without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> With this anſwer, that Noble-man was not a little edified.</p>

Be encouraged to the uſe of means in matters. <hi>Jacob</hi> had his Preſents for <hi>Eſau;</hi> and there was an honeſt policy in the manner of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Preſents ſent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 13, to <hi>v.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was earneſt with the King, ſaying, <hi>Let my ſupplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee, that thou cauſe me not to return to the houſe of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan the Scribe, leſt I dye there,</hi> Jer. 37. 20. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the common practiſe of God's people in the uſe of means, there are two things obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable; That they have uſed means notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the promiſe of God for the effecting of matters; and alſo, notwithſtanding remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

                        <hi>Providences</hi> diſplayed in their precedent preſervation. <hi>Jacob</hi> was under a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as to the Lord's care over him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Countrey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9, 12. and yet he uſeth the means, as before intimated. <hi>Paul</hi> had a promiſe for the lives of all in the Ship with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 24. and yet they that could ſwim, caſt themſelves firſt into the ſea, and gat to land; and the reſt, ſome on boards, and ſome on broken pieces of the ſhip; and ſo it came to paſs, that they eſcaped all ſafe to land, <hi>v.</hi> 44. yea, a paſſage there is, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> It ſeems then there is a [<hi>cannot</hi>] where means are not uſed, or ſo uſed; notwithſtanding the Purpoſe and Promiſe of God, which are ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as taking in the means to be uſed. And as for the other thing intimated, we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: <hi>Daniel</hi> had a good Cauſe, and good God, who did miraculouſly ſhut the Lions mouths; yet he is not puft up, to the ſlighting of the King's courteſie in his being taken up out of the Lions Den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Peter</hi> had a miraculous delivery out of the Priſon, and yet withdraws for a ſeaſon; <hi>he departed, and went into another place,</hi> Acts 12. 17. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this, let two things be remembred:</p>
                     <p>1. See the means be regular, or right means. Means are regular, (1.) In regard of natural cauſality, or tendency to the end. He that will plow his land, muſt not beat his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ow-ſhare into a Sword; and he that will go to battel, muſt not beat his Sword into a Pruning-hook. If <hi>Jeremiah</hi> muſt be had up out of the Dungeon,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:101303:249"/> he is not drawn up with a twine-thred, but with cords; and not only cords, but caſt-clouts and rags are to be put under his arm-holes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 11, 12, 13. (2.) In regard of a moral or inſtituted cauſality. Men muſt not under difficulties and diſtreſſes, with <hi>Saul,</hi> away to an <hi>Endor</hi>-woman, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 7, 8. To fall in with ſin, is to fall out with God, his Word, which warrants no ſuch means to be uſed. Not only piety, but an holy Prudence, muſt guide in the uſe of means. The circumſtances of a caſe, may have very much influence on determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation what, and how to be done, as in <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>2. Eye God dependently and ſubmiſſively in the uſe of means. <hi>Jacob</hi> did mind prayer to God, as well as the Preſents ſent. There was a conjunction of Piety and Policy. He was a wreſtler with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32—With many, the Means is the ſpeaking-Figure, and God the dumb Cypher in a buſineſs; but with <hi>Jacob</hi> it was not ſo. Let <hi>Jacob</hi>'s God be thy God in the uſe of the means, if thou wilt have him be thy God in the good ſucceſs of the means. Eye him therefore in all; and ſay as <hi>David, Let him do to me as ſeemeth him good,</hi> 2 Sam. 15. 26.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>PRAYER being an univerſal means to make uſe of in matters; a means to be coupled with other means; and a means, when no other means can be uſed; it may very well here fall under conſideration; and that, as it hath reference to <hi>Divine Providence</hi> for help. Now that it hath a befriending-influence for the good of perſons not only in Temporals, but in Spirituals, may be evidenced four ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Inſtitution of the Lord. Prayer is an inſtituted means by God. It is a <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, which returns with an Olive-branch in her mouth. If it be asked, When and where Prayer was inſtituted by the Lord? I may bid the party ſo demanding, to go to Paradiſe: for though <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency had no ſin to confeſs; yet he had a God to acknowledg. A Directory for Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was engraven on his heart. There was an
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:101303:250"/> Arbour for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Cloſet, as well as a Walk for his meditation in the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> He might not only be a thankſgiver for favours, but alſo a petitioner for the continuance of them. It may ſuffice then, That the Directory for Devotion was firſt publiſh't in Paradiſe, though it hath had various editions ſince, with ſuch additions as the Lord hath made in his holy word: And ſeeing then the Lord hath inſtituted this means for gracious ends, it's wiſdom to make uſe of this Bottom or Veſſel for the tranſporting Commodities, this Receit for a Cure, this Shooing-horn to draw on the Velvet-ſhoo of Mercy. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the nature, or at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Prayer. Prayer honours <hi>Providence</hi> in an addreſs made to a Throne of Grace. When Mercies are begged, <hi>Providence</hi> is acknowledged. 'Twas good Divinity, though from a bad hand, 2 King. 6. 27. <hi>If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> ſaid well that King, the ſon of a Murderer, as the Prophet calls him, <hi>v.</hi> 32. And as Prayer doth honour God in acknowledging his <hi>Providence;</hi> ſo <hi>Providence</hi> hath honoured Prayer, yea the ſhadow of it, witneſs <hi>Ahab</hi>'s devotion, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29. God's bounty, not <hi>Ahab</hi>'s deſert, was the ſource or riſe of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s mercy. If God do then caſt crumbs to Dogs who thus lye proſtrate before him; what encouragement have the children of the Kingdom to go to their Father? <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given unto you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you:</hi>
                        <pb n="486" facs="tcp:101303:251"/> 
                        <hi>for what man is there of you, whom if his ſon ask bread, will he give him a ſtone? or if he ask a fiſh, will he give him a ſerpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how much more ſhall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him,</hi> Mat. 7. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the Experience of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Prayer may well be termed the Royal Exchange, in a ſpiritual ſenſe: Here is a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering for choiſe Commodities, as Gold tried in the fire, white Rayment, Eye-ſalve, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Eſther,</hi> with the Jews, did labour hard at this Sacred Pump of Prayer; and their labour was not in vain: for their hands lifted up to Heaven, did knock down <hi>Haman</hi> with his Complices, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4. 16. with chap. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Peter</hi> was kept in priſon; but prayer was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing of the Church unto God for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5. Though <hi>Peter</hi> be in priſon, yet the Spirit of Prayer was at liberty, and ſets <hi>Peter</hi> at liberty: for the priſon, which like a <hi>Jonas</hi> his Whale had ſwallowed him, gives up the priſoner at the prayers of the Church. To this teſtimony of the Saints Experiences, add the teſtimony of God himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 19. <hi>I ſaid not unto the ſeed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. From the ſignal appearance of <hi>Providence</hi> at or nigh the very time that prayer is made. There ſeems to be ſomething in God's owning perſons whilſt they are at their work. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſervant obſerves this; ſaying, <hi>Before I had done ſpeaking in my heart, behold Rebeccah came forth with her pitcher,</hi> &amp;c. Gen 24. 45. In <hi>Abijah</hi>'s
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:101303:251"/> time <hi>they cried unto the Lord, and the prieſts ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trumpets; then the men of Judah gave a ſhout: and as the men of Judah ſhouted, it came to paſs, that God ſmote Jeroboam, and all Iſrael, before Abijah and Judah,</hi> 2 Chron. 13. 14, 15. <hi>And whiles</hi> (ſaith Daniel) <hi>I was ſpeaking and praying, and confeſſing my ſin, and the ſin of my people Iſrael, and preſenting my ſupplication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord my God, for the holy mountain of my God: yea, whiles I was a ſpeaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had ſeen in the viſion at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, being cauſed to flye ſwiftly, touched me about the time of the evening-oblation, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 9 20, 21. So in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. <hi>When they had prayed, the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And ſo, laſtly, to mention no more inſtances, That of <hi>Peter</hi> is pertinent; he was a priſoner, the people of God then knock at Heaven's door; and behold <hi>Peter</hi> knocks at the door of the houſe where many were gathered together praying, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 12.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>1. LEARN who are the men and women of gracious <hi>Providence;</hi> they are ſuch who make conſcience of ſerious prayer to God. They who go down into this Deep, ſee the wondrous works of God. <hi>Noah, Daniel, Job,</hi> are the men who can do much with <hi>Providence,</hi> if any thing be to be done, as is intimated <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. And, the effectual, ſervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much, <hi>James</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                     <p>2. How ſad is the ſtate of thoſe, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of laying up a ſtock of Prayers, lay up a treaſure of Guilts! They curſe, blaſpheme, revile, lye, oppreſs, perſecute thoſe who wiſh well to them, and pray for them. Theſe continuing the old trade of ſin, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that <hi>Providence</hi> ſhould look from <hi>Mount Gerrizzim</hi> to bleſs them; but from <hi>Mount E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> to curſe them. An heavy hand of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> will meet with ſuch who make light of Prayer; and trample, like Swine, this Pearl, with other Pearls, under their feet. See <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14, 15. with 17, 18, 19, 20, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>3. Obſerve one ground amongſt others, why pious ones are ſo taken up in prayer to God. They well know their own Trade. A Merchant, who often ſends his Ship to one
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:101303:252"/> and the ſame Port, hath reaſon for it. A Child is ever and anon in a room, and there is an Honey-comb. God's Children find it good for them to draw near to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 28.</p>
                     <p>4. Know who are the beſt provident Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for Children; they are ſuch, who by their prayers to God, engage <hi>Providence</hi> to be a Portion and Joynture for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. A little, with a bleſſing, left to ſome, will out-laſt Farms, Mannors, yea Kingdoms, left to others with a curſe. Pious Parents, in being praying Parents, are provident Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; they pray not in vain: God may hear prayer for poſterity one way or other: See <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 20.</p>
                     <p>5. Wicked men then are fools in their Rages and ſubtil Contrivances againſt pious praying-ones. How quickly may God hear the groans of his people, and ſo ſweep away the Bodies of wicked men to their Graves, and their Souls to Hell? There was a prayer made for <hi>Peter,</hi> and the deſign againſt him was broken; and a prodigious death is the lot of an <hi>Herod</hi> who had deſigned the death of <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 12. 23.</p>
                     <p>6. There is no reaſon to lay aſide Prayer, no, not whilſt in the world. We ſhall ſtill ſtand in need of the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. Daily-<hi>Providence</hi> calls for daily-Prayer. It's pride to an height of it, to think that Prayer is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a grown Chriſtian. When perſons ſtand not in need of <hi>Providence</hi> to help, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue its help, they may not ſo ſtand in need
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:101303:253"/> of prayer. But alas! where are the men, or rather monſters, who owe no debt to <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</hi> The holy Scriptures do ſufficiently confute this fancy: ſee <hi>Job</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
                     <p>7. See, whence it is that the Devil makes oppoſition againſt prayer. He is a cunning Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and knows, that ſerious prayer is the Chriſtian's Plate-Fleet. He is ſenſible of the knocks and bruiſes which prayer gives his Serpent's head. He hath been an obſerver of what great things God hath done on the prayers of his people. No wonder then, if he throw dirt and ſtones into this Well; jogs the Chriſtian when he is ready to fire at the mark; and ſhakes his hand, when he is about to write down his humble petition to God, ſee <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>8. Look not on thoſe as enemies, who call on you to call on God with your Families. Shall a Phyſician be thanked for the Body? a Lawyer for the Eſtate? And is the Body, Eſtate, Soul, and all, of no regard, as the concerns of all lye at ſtake in another way, and that the beſt way too? Surely they are Friends who antidote you againſt the curſe of God: ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 33.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Obſerve the incomes of <hi>Providence</hi> by way of return unto prayer. If it be ſaid here,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have prayed, and prayed, and yet no ſuch returns are made as the Meditation or Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Providence imports.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:101303:253"/>
                     <p>I might at large reply, but that would be a digreſſion. In a few things, therefore, to ſtop the mouth from ſlandering the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, take notice of what follows.</p>
                     <p>1. Is the particular thing thou prayeſt for, warranted for kind? Pride and Paſſion make wild petitions for the kind of them: ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>2. What is thy end in praying for things though warranted? ſee <hi>James</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                     <p>3. Do you pray in Chriſt's Name, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſerious ſort? See <hi>John</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. <hi>James</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                     <p>4. Is not Prayer contradicted by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy walking? Some are like black clouds, ſtill black, and that notwithſtanding thunder and lightning breaks from them: ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 4.</p>
                     <p>5. Do you not lye under ſome miſtake about God's <hi>Providence</hi> in anſwer to prayer? For hearing of prayer is not to be defined by God's doing all we wiſh for; but what God ſees beſt for us. God anſwers, when the thing may not be given in for kind. <hi>Paul</hi> was heard, when not heard, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. The denial of one thing is the way that <hi>Providence</hi> may take for granting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A man prays for Health, and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the World: God, by the want of Health, mortifies to the World.</p>
                     <p>6. The queſtion is, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:101303:254"/> the goods you have left in the hand of <hi>Providence.</hi> Wait then ſtill on God; let the Lord alone to anſwer when and how he pleaſeth.

                     <p>1. LEARN who they are who ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively long after the change of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the great or laſt Change of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> they are thoſe who have had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of a bleſſed change of <hi>Providence</hi> on their hearts here, and who have profited by the various changes of <hi>Providence</hi> in this world. So the Apoſtle; <hi>While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen, are temporal: but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 18. See alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 20.</p>
                     <p>2. It's wiſdom then to work before the night cometh when no man can work, as our Saviour Chriſt phraſeth it, <hi>John</hi> 9. 4. Two things are here conſiderable:</p>
                     <p>1. Secure we Spiritual Riches whileſt the Goſpel-Mine is open. Be not fooliſh Virgins, who have their Bags and Coſſers, but no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them. They had their Lamps of Profeſſion, but no Oyl in their Veſſels; they may juſtly be ſhut out of Heaven, whoſe hearts were ſhut againſt the real admiſſion of Chriſt by his grace on earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3, 11, 12. Oh! Eternity is no trifle! Men ſhould be in good earneſt for it; <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent</hi>
                        <pb n="497" facs="tcp:101303:256"/> 
                        <hi>take it by force,</hi> Mat. 11. 12. And now is the ſeaſon, or never, to look after the means of grace, and grace by the means: <hi>Abraham</hi> tells the rich man, who would have a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſent from Hell, <hi>They have Moſes and the prophets, let them hear them,</hi> Luke 16. 29.</p>
                     <p>2. Honour God with Temporal Riches, as you have opportunity. Are there no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel; poor Scholars, who may be ſerviceable for the Church of Chriſt; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Widows, Orphans, to taſte of your bounty? What a folly is there in the moſt, who have their <note place="margin">Cave, ne intra loculos tuos includas ſalutem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opum, &amp; tanquam in tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulis ſepeliac vitam pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perum. <hi>Ambroſ.</hi> lib. 2. de officio. c. 16.</note> hands full of the World, and their hearts empty of love to Chriſt, his Intereſt, and conſequently their own good!

Now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhifts and put offs men have, to the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the hand of <hi>Providence,</hi> the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures learn us otherwiſe. The deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> is attributed to God as the righteous Author thereof; and yet there are not wanting ſome, who impute that viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſolation (which cannot be denied) to a meer contingency of Second-Cauſes; and this imputation of theirs is contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which doth in an eminent ſort ſet forth the hand of God as falling heavy on the ſaid places, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24, 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. It's worthy of obſervation, that there are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given by Authors, why there are frequent and violent tempeſts in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>-Sea where <hi>Jonah</hi> ſail'd, and yet there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to turn <hi>Providence</hi> over-board with <hi>Jonah</hi> in his voyage through theſe mighty waters; for it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord ſent out a great wind into the ſea,</hi> Jonah 1. 4.

                     <p>2. ABUSE not <hi>Providence,</hi> by uſing it as a Shooing-horn to draw on ſin, or as a Shoo-buckle to faſten it on. Suppoſe ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Ruffians did want a certain ſum of money, and on the road-way did leight on a man who had the exact ſum; which they ſeize on, and after thrive in robbery: <hi>Providence</hi> is in no wiſe a Patron to their ſin, though the tabernacles of theſe robbers proſper, as it's ſaid <hi>Job</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Abimelech</hi> finds a ſilver-ſtirrop, and men to hold it, in order to his mounting up into the Saddle of an uſurped Government, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>They gave him threeſcore and ten pieces of ſilver out of the houſe of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain men and light perſons which followed him.</hi> We read, That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt's <hi>coming is after the working of Satan with all power, and ſigns and lying wonders,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 9. Without queſtion, there muſt be the Providence of God in ſending ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, for ſo (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) it's affirmed; and yet Providence is not to be charg'd with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told deceits. I have read, how Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> confirmed (by a pretended revelation) the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Maſs, whereas unto the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:101303:259"/> year 780, the Liturgy of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed; it was put to the deciſion of <hi>Providence,</hi> whether that of <hi>Gregory,</hi> or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſhould continue? The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was this: Both were laid on the Altar, and the Church-doors ſhut; and reſolved it was, that they ſhould give themſelves to prayer all night, That God would reveal ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken which of the two Services he would have uſed in Churches. In the morning they find <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Maſs-book pluck't aſunder, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all the Church over; but <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Book laid open in the place where they laid it. This <hi>Adrian</hi> thus expounded the matter; That as the leaves were ſcattered, ſo ſhould <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Maſs-book be uſed throughout the World; and that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Liturgy ſhould be obſerved only in his own Church at <hi>Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanum.</hi> And ſo upon this jugling-wonder <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is abuſed to countenance the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Maſs-book. Far be it then from good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to put tricks on <hi>Providence.</hi> It's wiſdom to diſtinguiſh between a <hi>Providence</hi> which may ſerve by way of probation, and a <hi>Providence</hi> by way of invitation. That <hi>Providence</hi> may be a Touchſtone, which ought not to be a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. <hi>Providence</hi> makes good the thing ſpoken by a falſe prophet, and yet this is no ground to forſake the true God; ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. Moreover, it's wiſdom to remember the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's rule, <hi>We muſt not do evil that good may come,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. The Lord's bringing good out of evil, is no warrant for a man to defile his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with evil. The Lord's not putting a
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:101303:259"/> ſtop to ſin, diſmantles not the tower of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs againſt ſin. Conſcience muſt not become the Devil's Muck-heap, though <hi>Providence</hi> knows how to gather Roſes from the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of men's luſts. The Doctrine of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> hath its good uſes; men ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they put not abuſes for ſuch uſes.</p>

                     <p>3. TAKE heed of impoſing on, or tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Providence.</hi> There is a difference between a modeſt propoſal with a ſubmiſſion to God's diſpoſal; and an impoſal or tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The former hath an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for it ſelf, as in <hi>Gideon</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 36, <hi>to the end of the chapter.</hi> The later ſprings from another root, as namely, diſtruſt of God, or preſumption on his <hi>Providence,</hi> or ſome other inordinate luſt. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lothe Manna, and fleſh (forſooth) they muſt have; <hi>they luſted exceedingly in the wilderneſs, and tempted God in the deſert,</hi> Pſal. 106. 14. <hi>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderneſs, and grieve him in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert? yea, they turned back, and tempted God, and limited the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 78. 40, 41. It was Satan's deſign to have drawn our Saviour to impoſe on <hi>Providence</hi> by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous converſion of ſtones into bread when he was an hungred; and to tempt <hi>Providence</hi> for preſervation, by throwing
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:101303:260"/> himſelf down from the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Temple, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4 3, <note place="margin">Qualis via haec, de pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo Templi mittere ſe deorſum?

That way of purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from infamous reports, called by the name of <hi>Ordel,</hi> when the party was blind-folded, and glowing hot irons were laid in the way where the party ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was to go bare-footed; and the eſcapal of the hot irons was a teſtimony of innocency; may juſtly be reprehended as a tempting of <hi>Providence.</hi> They may do well therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how they gratifie the Devil, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the due uſe of means, or venture beyond warrant from God, and ſo are more bold than welcome to the houſe of <hi>Providence,</hi> be the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue whatſoever it may be. An inſtance we have of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who preſumed to go up to the top of the hill, and there had a bloody repulſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 44, 45. I have read of <hi>Franciſcus,</hi> who offered the Sultan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to try the truth of the Chriſtian Religion in oppoſition to falſe Religion, by venturing himſelf in the fire; and though the Sultan wav'd the experiment, yet that was no ground for the Monk to wave repentance for his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let care then be had, men tempt not, or impoſe on <hi>Providence</hi> in regard (1.) of what ſhall be done. Man is not to preſcribe, but ſubſcribe to <hi>Providence.</hi> Man's Wit and Will
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:101303:260"/> muſt ſtoop to the Wiſdom and Pleaſure of God; <hi>For</hi> (as the Lord ſaith) <hi>my counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure,</hi> Iſa. 46. 10. (2.) In regard how and when this or that ſhall be done. <hi>Jacob</hi> is a prevailer, yet he is not a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enquirer, much leſs a peremptory preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how God ſhall deliver him from the fury of his brother <hi>Eſau:</hi> And as <hi>Jacob,</hi> now more aged, and ſo wiſe, did act regularly herein; ſo was he faulty in being too haſty with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the bleſſing to be given him: for though the Father lay on his death-bed, yet he was not ſpeechleſs; and if ſo, yet God could have open'd the Father's mouth to pronounce the bleſſing, without the Son's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening his mouth to tell a lye.</p>

                     <p>4. VVATCH againſt diſcontents at, or reflexive replies on, the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of God. The former evil of impoſing on <hi>Providence,</hi> doth make way for undue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies againſt <hi>Providence. Jonah</hi> would impoſe on <hi>Providence</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Nineveh;</hi> and having not his humour gratified, how ſaucy and malepert is he! Take heed then of a <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>-like pettiſhneſs and frowardneſs under the <hi>Providences</hi> of God. This reflexive froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs puts forth it ſelf,</p>
                     <p>1. In the heart, the forge of the natural ſpirits, and morally evil ones too. The Devil
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:101303:261"/> put it into the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, and ſo in effect to bid <hi>Providence</hi> to take back its kindneſs in vouchſafing ſuch a Maſter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 2. It was an heart-evil that <hi>David</hi> was guilty of, and it was an interpretative reply againſt <hi>Providence</hi> in not checking <hi>Saul</hi> from <hi>David</hi>'s imaginary falling by the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1.</p>
                     <p>2. In Speech or Language. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> charges <hi>Job</hi> with this evil, ſaying, <hi>Why doth thine heart carry thee away? And what do thine eyes wink, that thou turneſt thy ſpirit againſt God, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſuch words go out of thy mouth?</hi> Job 15. 12, 13. The Lord tells them by the Prophet <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> that <hi>their words had been ſtout againſt him:</hi> and what words they were, reflexive ones on the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, as is expreſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>3. In Geſture, Converſation, or otherwiſe. <hi>Cain</hi>'s diſcontent at the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in having reſpect unto <hi>Abel</hi> and his Offering, appears in his outward deportment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Why art thou wroth? and why is thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance fallen?</hi> It may go for no contradiction here. Men ſpeak aloud againſt <hi>Providence</hi> whilſt they are ſullenly ſilent, or teſtifie their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content ſome other way. Some pretend more manners than directly to flye out againſt God; and yet the ſtone which they dare not throw againſt Heaven, they are ready to throw at his ſervants on Earth. Thus dealt the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> of old with <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Becauſe there were no graves in Egypt, haſt thou taken us away to dye in the wilderneſs,</hi> Exod. 14. 11. Good <hi>Job</hi>
                        <pb n="507" facs="tcp:101303:261"/> was of another frame and temper; he did not pour forth a flood of curſes on the plunderers; neither did he fall into a ſmoaking-paſſion with the ſervants who eſcaped, blaming them for want of fore-light, in regard of the enemies approach; no, he eyes God in all, and ſo char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not God fooliſhly, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22.

                     <p>And as there are Exemplifications of ſuch who reſiſt <hi>Providence</hi> ſmiling: ſo there are, likewiſe, of ſuch, who oppugn <hi>Providence</hi> frowning. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart is hardned, and that notwithſtanding the ſeveral plagues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. <hi>Ahaz</hi> in the time of his diſtreſs did treſpaſs yet more againſt the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 22. <hi>When the fourth Angel poured forth his vial, men were ſcorched with great heat, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the name of God which hath power over theſe plagues; and they repented not, to give him glory,</hi> Rev. 16. 9. Theſe Inſtances may ſuffice: Others of both ſorts of Reſiſters, who wage warr againſt Heaven, might be added. Let it be our care to depart from the Tents of theſe men, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> who were Rebels againſt <hi>Providence, Numb.</hi> 16. 26. And to the end we make no ſtay, but ſtye the Tents of ſuch fighters againſt God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we two things:</p>
                     <p>1. Other ſins make men Beaſts, this ſin makes men Devils. The Drunkard and Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:101303:262"/> fill their paunches with the Creatures; but oppugners of <hi>Providence</hi> do more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly violate the Law of the Creator. <hi>Ye are</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the ſtubborn <hi>Jews</hi> for whom God had done much in giving them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and againſt whom Gods had lifted up his hand, for now they had the <hi>Roman</hi> yoak on their necks) <hi>of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do,</hi> Joh. 8. 44.</p>
                     <p>2. What do men get by their reſiſting of <hi>Providence? Balaam</hi> was very near deſtruction in his perverſe way, as the Angel declares unto him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 32, 33. And though <hi>Providence</hi> do not by and by appear in its garment dipt in blood; yet it's folly for men to promiſe themſelves victory over <hi>Providence;</hi> for they may ſooner ſink, with Elder-guns, an Armado of ſtrong-built Ships, and batter down Rocks of Adamant with Snow-balls, than be too hard for <hi>Providence.

                     </p>
                     <p>1. Perilous journeys, ere men are returned to places of their habitation from which they have been held by reaſon of captivity. This from <hi>v.</hi> 1, to 10.</p>
                     <p>2. Grievous impriſonments, ſo that little hope of life, as in <hi>Peter</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. This from <hi>v.</hi> 10, to 17.</p>

                     <p>Now from this diſtribution or diviſion of dangers, it may be argued, If all ſuch who have had God's Providence propitious towards them in Journeys, Priſons, Sickneſs, Tempeſts at Sea, ſhall hereupon infer a true and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right to the diſtinguiſhing-grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, they will build upon a Sandy-foundation.

GIVE not way to groundleſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious conceits about ſome Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of <hi>Providence.</hi> Some are for obſerving a <hi>Providence</hi> as ſuch, or according to a gloſs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their fancy put on it. They are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly ſerious about trifles, and trifle about ſerious matters. Squibs and Crackers of their own make, are more dreaded, than the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Artillery of Heaven. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Third Commandment, ſaith thus of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: <hi>It is an opinion conceited of the works of God's Providence, the reaſon whereof can neither be drawn out of the word of God, nor the whole courſe of Nature: As for example; That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie for one in the morning to put on his ſhoo awry; or, To put the left ſhoo on the right foot; To ſneeze in drawing on his ſhooes; To have Salt fall towards him; To have a Hare croſs him; To bleed ſome few drops of blood; To burn on the right ear. Again, That it is contrarily good luck, To find old Iron; To have drink ſpilled on him; For the left ear to burn; To pare our nails on ſome certain day of the week; To dream of ſome certain things.</hi> Thus that man of God (who is ſaid to be one of the men who taught Engliſh-men how to worſhip God) adjudged ſuch fancies to be far from true worſhipping of God. There is one vulgar Obſervation which is not by the forenamed Author expreſly nominated; but too freequently heeded by ſuch who are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vers'd in the tranſmitted principles of this
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:101303:265"/> kind of traditional Catechiſm, than in the Bible, and that is this, <hi>viz.</hi> A black concluſion inferred, from the Rats or Mice eating clothes, or wearing-apparel; no leſs than the death of the party is now concluded: And becauſe ſuch Principles as above-named are ſo rooted in the hearts of ſome; I ſhall in a little ſpeak to this laſt; for a meer nomination of this erroneous conceit, is not accounted a confutation by ſuch <hi>Ignaro's:</hi> Firſt then, It is not denied, but that the <hi>Providence</hi> of God reacheth to the Rats and the Mice: which creatures he doth uſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as very remarkable ſcourges to the ſons of men. <note place="margin">Multis haec quidem fabuloſa habentur: at turris illa, cui a Muribus nomen eſt, in hunc uſ<expan>

In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 4. there is mention made of Golden Mice which the Prieſts and the Diviners ordered to be ſent with the Ark; and the reaſon we have in <hi>v.</hi> 5. where it's ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall make Images of your Emerods, and Images of your Mice, that marr the land.</hi> By this it appears, that God puniſhed
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:101303:266"/> them in their Barns and Fields by Mice, as well as in their Bodies by Diſeaſes. <hi>Providence</hi> by Mice doth tame the pride of the <hi>Philiſtin</hi>-Lords. An Army of Mice doth more than an Army of <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> (2.) Though <hi>Providence</hi> extends to the Rats and Mice; yet marring and ſpoiling the Garment by ſuch, is not a prognoſtick of death. For (1.) it's proper and commmon to theſe creatures to waſte and ſpoil. Hunger makes them break through ſuch ſoft walls. <hi>Cato,</hi> when one made a doleful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that a Rat had gnawn his Hoſe; replied, It was no marvel; but much more, if his Hoſe had gnawn the Rat. (2.) May not that be ſometimes imputed to the Rat and the Mice, which may cauſally be charg'd on the ſloveneſs, and negligence of parties in point of due care had about their garments? (3.) There may be a Catechizing-Providence for ſome ſin in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the very clothes eaten. As God prepared a Worm, and ate down the Guord with which <hi>Jonah</hi> too much pleaſed himſelf, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 6, 7. So it may hold here by way of analogy; and this caſualty may bring to remembrance Pride, Oppreſſion, or ſome other ſin; or may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of Liberality; the Garment may ſerve ſome other: And thus an improving of the <hi>Providence</hi> may do good to the ſoul, and bring on God's bleſſing the more; yea, to the length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth of life, if <hi>Providence</hi> ſee fit; and then its far from being a neceſſary prognoſtick of death. (4) Whatever ſome urge as to the verifying of the thing from experience, I have known the contrary in one, who is left only
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:101303:266"/> alive of the whole Family; and yet that party ſo left, had his Garment eaten, to the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome, conſidering the circumſtances, when, where, and how. The beſt way then is to ſecure the Wedding-garment, ſpoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 12. No Rats, no, not the great Rat of Hell, ſhall gnaw this to pieces. He need not dread a Winding-ſheet, who is clothed with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>

Men keep not the King of Heaven's high-way, but go aſide on the right hand or on the left; and ſo <hi>Providence</hi> hath not their company. A <hi>Providence</hi> very eminent there was, in the return of thoſe ſent to ſpy out the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> but how are the people affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? One while, <hi>Let us make us a Captain, and let us return into Egypt, ſaid they one to another,</hi> Numb. 14 4. Another while ſay they, <hi>Lo we be here, and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promiſed,</hi> v. 40. God in his Providence ſets up <hi>Saul</hi> to be King; ſome deſpiſed him, and brought him no Preſents, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27. Others were too hot and furious, and would have the King's robe dipt in blood; <hi>Bring the men, ſay they, that we may put them to death,</hi> 1 Sam. 11. 12. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt never waſh my feet,</hi> Joh. 13. 7, 8. and after, <hi>Lord, not my feet only, but alſo my hands and my head,</hi> v. 9. Men have ground therefore to be watchful againſt extreams in matters: for, lame feet in not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a Providence; and Hind's feet in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running a Providence, become not judicious Chriſtians.</p>

                     <p>1. RESOLVE to take a ſerious view of the Lord's Providential Diſpenſations. A well biaſſed Reſolution is the Spring of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To the end therefore thou mayeſt be in good earneſt, conſider of the Incentives or Motives, which are as followeth.</p>
                     <p>1. To note and obſerve the Works of God's Providence, is a commanded duty. Men are not left to a luke-warm indifferency, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will obſerve or no. God hath other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcovered himſelf in his word. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I did ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael.</hi> Here are two things: (1.) What God did do. (2.) What they are to do. The Lord he works, and they are not to be idle, but to take a view of His work, by taking a journey in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations to <hi>Shiloh.</hi> In <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. when the Book there of the Lord's Secrets is to be opened in a way of Providential Diſpenſation, there is a [<hi>Come and ſee</hi>]; a ſight indeed not to be fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:101303:268"/> things in Scripture, as they may intimate our dulneſs, ſo the weight or importance of things thus repeated. But,</p>
                     <p>2. As it is commanded-work to obſerve the Lord's out-goings in his <hi>Providence;</hi> ſo it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and that three ways: (1) By the variety of terms uſed to expreſs this duty. There ſeems to be a depth, when ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom of Cordage go to the ſounding of this duty. An heap of words there are to ſet forth the excellency and emphatical importance of it. Thus in Iſa. 41. 10. <hi>That they may ſee, and know, and conſider, and underſtand together.</hi> (2.) It is commended to us from the Author, whoſe works we are to take a view of. <hi>Come and ſee the works of God,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 66. 5. What more in the World than the curious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of the Divine Attributes, ſhould court the eyes of men to dwell on? And laſtly, It's commended from the Practiſe of God's Saints. It is commendable to do, not as the moſt do, but as the beſt do. <hi>By faith the elders obtained a good report,</hi> Heb. 11. 2. That <hi>faith</hi> there is comprehenſive of <hi>Providence</hi> for its object, as the Exemplifications given in the Chapter do give us to underſtand. It's recorded to the commendation of <hi>Mary,</hi> That ſhe had an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant eye on the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                     <p>3. In the third place, The ſingular advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which attend the due obſervation of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> do invite to this duty. If a man will conſult his own good, here is the way, and this is the dore: For,</p>
                     <p>1. By a wiſe obſerving God's <hi>Providence,</hi> a
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:101303:269"/> man is the more furthered in the knowledg of God. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in the School of <hi>Providence</hi> is taught what he learnt not before. <hi>Providence</hi> fetters him, and kicks him, as a Ball, as far as <hi>Babylon;</hi> and there he is catechiſed, ſo as it is ſaid of him, <hi>Then Manaſſeh knew that the Lord be was God,</hi> 2 Chron. 33. 11, 12, 13. Holy <hi>Job,</hi> though a knowing-man, hath his knowledg elevated. He learnt that on the Dung-hill, which he did not in his Mannor-houſe: <hi>I have heard</hi> (ſaith he to God) <hi>by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye ſeeth thee,</hi> Job 42. 5.</p>
                     <p>2. Hereby a man is the better armed againſt ſin. <hi>Providence,</hi> in a way of mercy, is a good Rhetorician to diſſwade from ſin <hi>Did not thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (it's ſpoken to <hi>Shallum</hi>) <hi>eat, and drink, and do judgment, and juſtice, and then it was well with him?</hi> Jer. 22. 15. And <hi>Providence</hi> in way of wrath, may ſerve as a counter-poyſon againſt ſin. He may well be afraid of the black coal of ſin, knowing how <hi>Providence</hi> hath made it a burning-coal to the ſinner, as to <hi>Sodom</hi> of old: ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. ſee alſo <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 25, 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7, 8, 9, 10. Moreover, the obſerving of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> doth antidote againſt ſin, as a man deſerts not ſinfully his appointed ſtation, knowing that there is a <hi>Providence</hi> of God watching over his people. <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> ch. 6. v. 11? This good man's heart was not in his heels; for his eyes were fix't on God's <hi>Providence,</hi> ſee <hi>v.</hi> 9, and 14. A like inſtance we have in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 31, 32. But laſtly, A man learns not to venture on ſin for releaſe from troubles, and for the obtaining of good things, knowing
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:101303:269"/> the variety of ways that <hi>Providence</hi> hath to help without a man's ſin. Thus <hi>David</hi> will not kill a King for a Kingdom; the knowledg of the variety of ways which <hi>Providence</hi> had to ſend <hi>Saul</hi> out of the world, is a pull-back to <hi>David. The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to dye, or he ſhall deſcend into battel and periſh,</hi> 1 Sam. 26. 10.</p>
                     <p>3. A third Advantage by obſerving <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> is, Calmneſs and quietneſs of ſpirit in the midſt of an unquiet world. As he who can ſwim well, is in the midſt of curled waves; he is in them, but they are not in him: ſo he who hath an holy dexterity in ſwimming in the ſea of <hi>Providence,</hi> the better bears out, and bears up; he is in trouble, but trouble is not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in him, as in others. He may ſometimes take in a mouth-full of briniſh-water, but not a belly-full. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. we have a deſcription of the Churches troubles; <hi>the heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved,</hi> v. 6. <hi>yet we will not fear,</hi> v. 2. And what is the ground of this fearleſneſs, or compoſedneſs of ſpirit? That we have in <hi>v.</hi> 7, and 8. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts in with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge, Selah. Come, behold the works of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. It's ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> when the people talk't of ſtoning him, he <hi>encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God,</hi> 1 Sam. 30. 6. The fiery furnace of the zealous King for his Image, ſets not the ſpirits of <hi>Shadrach, Meſech,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bednego,</hi> into a combuſtion; they have a cool ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though warm towards God; and caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God would one way or other period
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:101303:270"/> the controverſie, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Hereby the way of going out of the world, is rendred the more eaſie and pleaſant, by obſerving the gracious out-goings of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> towards a man in the world. He may cheerfully go through death's dark Entry, who hath had experience before of the Lord's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him in the vale and ſhadow of death. Good <hi>Jacob</hi> on his death bed looks back on the ſeries or chain of God's <hi>Providence</hi> towards him, and looks forward by faith to <hi>Providence,</hi> as the Truſtee for his poſterity. <hi>He bleſſed Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, and ſaid, God before whom my fathers Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Iſaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from all evil, bleſs the lads,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 15, 16. <hi>David</hi> being likewiſe to leave the world, hath an eye on what God had done for him, and on what he would do for his Family: ſo in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. there is a recognition, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count taken of what God had done for <hi>David, v.</hi> 1. and in <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>David</hi> caſts an eye on the Lord's Promiſe, a fruitful Seed plot of gracious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations: <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my houſe he not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he make it not to grow.</hi> And thus the way to dye comfortably, as well as to live holily, is to obſerve God's <hi>Providence</hi> judiciouſly.</p>

                     <p>2. SECURE an intereſt or propriety in the God of <hi>Providence,</hi> as reconciled to the ſoul in and through Jeſus Chriſt. What the marrow of divine bleſſing is, <hi>Peter</hi> gives us to underſtand in that Sermon of his made to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt God having rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> All outward bleſſings (as they are commonly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) are but dry bones, if this marrow of pardoning-grace be wanting. <hi>Luther</hi> calls all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magnificence, Wealth, Power, but a crumb caſt to a dog. Varniſh (they ſay) is no colour, yet it ſets off colours, puts a beauty on them: a propriety in God, that varniſheth all the outward bleſſings of God. This draws a golden thred through all thy Creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Thy food, thy health, thy rayment, thy relations, become double bleſſings this way; yea, thy wants, thy ſickneſs, thy reproaches, have loſt their ſtings; for if God be thine, theſe are thine for thy good. The Covenant of Grace hath made an happy converſion of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles into Medicines; and <hi>Providence</hi> hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the Cure; a Phyſician able enough to perform what is ſo undertaken. To ſum up all then, Good reaſon is there to look after this intereſt in God as reconciled: for, (1.) Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ones have no ſolid ground of any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hopes in God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. (2.) They who have God for their God, have a filial right to
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:101303:271"/> the Promiſes, which have gracious Providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſpenſations in the belly of them: they can go to God the Fountain of <hi>Providence,</hi> and have their bottles filled. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>cry unto God moſt high, unto God that performeth all things for me. He ſhall ſend from heaven, and ſave me,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 57. 2, 3. yea, they have a pledg given them, That their very ſtripes inflicted by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> ſhall be healing ones: ſo much doth that intimate in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 30, 31, 32.</p>

                     <p>3. GET more and more acquaintance with the holy Scriptures, in order to profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the School of <hi>Divine Providence. Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all wiſdom,</hi> is <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. If God's Word be received as our Inmate, we ſhall not be ſuch ſtrangers to <hi>Providence</hi> as others are; and that, (1.) Becauſe the Scripture hath a finger to unty the hard knots of <hi>Providence.</hi> A parallel or like Exemplification, or ſomething by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, is contained in the Scriptures which gives light to a dark diſpenſation, and ſo gives ground to ſay in this ſenſe, as is ſaid <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Is there any thing whereof it may be ſaid, See, this is new? It hath been of old time,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) The reaſon why ſome are ſo baffled and troubled about ſome Diſpenſations, is from not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Word of God aright. He that ſhall miſtake a Promiſe, will be upon a temptation
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:101303:271"/> to quarrel at a Providence. The promiſe to <hi>David</hi>'s ſeed, had its primary reference to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Son of <hi>David;</hi> and for lack of ſo conſidering of it, no wonder if trouble riſe high in an <hi>Iſraelite</hi>'s breaſt, when <hi>David</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in regard of external magnificence falls low: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 35. <hi>with the following verſes.</hi> The Prophet there, or Pen-man of that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> makes a ſad complaint, whilſt an eye is had upon deſolations there ſpoken of; not that he doth accuſe the Almighty of inconſtancy, but makes his moan to God by reaſon of a ſeeming claſhing of Providence with the Promiſe. Senſe and Reaſon do ſometimes raiſe a duſt, but Faith allays all; and the Prophet's ſtorm ends in a calm, <hi>v.</hi> 52. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord for evermore, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Amen.</hi> (3.) For want of a ſound and ſavoury acquaintance with the Word, a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is little improved, yea, miſimproved. That Diſpenſation that ſhould open the eyes, ſhuts them. <hi>Ahab</hi> chargeth the troubles of <hi>Iſrael</hi> on <hi>Elijah;</hi> but by the light from the Word, he might have gone into <hi>Obadiah</hi>'s hiding-hole, and ſeen there the ejected Prophets, and then concluded who did trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Heathen in the <note place="margin">Si <hi>Tiberis</hi> aſcendit ad moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, fi Nilus non aſcendit in arva, ſi coelum ſtetit, ſi terra movet, ſi fames ſi lues, ſtatim Chriſtianos ad leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. <hi>Tert.</hi> in Apolog.</note> primitive times attributed the calamities which befel the Empire, to the Chriſtians, and to the neglect of the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their Idols, which the Chriſtian Religion did forbid, and ſo in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſacrific'd their Heatheniſh Sacrifices.

                     <p>Now if it be asked here, <hi>What may be the ends or uſes which Providence intends?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I may reply, That as there are variety of Diſpenſations, ſo of Ends and Uſes attending ſuch; yea, there may be various ends in one and the ſame <hi>Providence</hi> (underſtand the word [Ends] as vulgarly uſed, and in a ſubordinate
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:101303:273"/> ſenſe to God's glory, the great and laſt End.) This of the various Aſpects of <hi>Providence</hi> hath been before treated of. Here it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that whatever be ſaid of the Ends or Uſes of <hi>Providence,</hi> is not by way of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Word. <hi>Providence</hi> doth co-witneſs with the <hi>Word.</hi> To fix a meaning on a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> which the holy Scriptures do article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, is to falſifie, or be-lye a <hi>Providence.</hi> God's Providential Diſpenſations then may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as they may ſerve divers ways.</p>

Some, who would not believe the exiſtency of Witches, have been laſh't into another belief, when God in a wiſe and righteous Diſpenſation hath let looſe ſuch Dogs on them.

                     <p>2.

That <hi>Providence</hi> referring to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> with thoſe at his houſe; the way of <hi>Peter</hi>'s coming to them, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit poured forth on them; might well leſſon, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Goſpel-priviledges with the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. The doctrine of man's inability to ſelf-converſion, hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the School of <hi>Providence.</hi> Let men ſtate Converſion-work aright, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth; obſerve the hardneſs of men's hearts, notwithſtanding ſoftning-means, which are ſo when and where the Lord bleſſeth the means; let them hear the ſavoury and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Narratives of ſound Converts; and they may well be induced to give more line, than ſome will allow, to that of Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. By way of Conviction of, or rouſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:101303:274"/> from ſome ſin or other in point of Practiſe. Though it be not the glaſs, as the Word; yet it may, as an hand, hold up the glaſs before the face of the guilty. <hi>Joſeph</hi> his brethren met with an awakening-Providence in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 42. 21. That in <hi>Job</hi> 36. is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent here: <hi>And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded; he openeth alſo their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity,</hi> v 8, 9, 10. <hi>Providence</hi> then hath a way for acceſs to the conſciences of men; and that not only by general alarums, but by more particular and remarkable inſinuations or windings, if I may ſo phraſe it. An inſtance we have in God's Providential dealing with <hi>Jonah: Thou haſt had pity</hi> (ſaith the Lord to froward <hi>Jonah</hi>) <hi>on the guord, for the which thou haſt not laboured, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther madeſt it grow; which came up in a night, and periſhed in a night: and ſhould not I ſpare Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi> &amp;c.? <hi>Jon.</hi> 4. 10. 11. God doth uſher in a conviction of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s unreaſonable paſſion, even from the guord, in and about which there was a remarkable diſplay of <hi>Providence</hi> both as to its growth and withering. To this of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> I ſhall add a ſtory out of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Poſtills. We read (ſaith he) of a certain Father, who by reaſon of impatience and diſcontent at the provocations which did occur in the place of his abode, did purpoſe to get him gone, and alone in peace live to God in a Wilderneſs. Where when he lived ſolitary, it hapned once, that his earthen drinking-cup did overturn;
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:101303:274"/> which he by and by ſet up again: this cup in like ſort falls again, which he ſets up right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and whenas it fell the third time, he (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in a feud or paſſion) daſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th it on the ground, and it broke into ſmall pieces: but by and by be thinking himſelf, <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I cannot have peace with my ſelf, I ſee I have ſinned:</hi> and forthwith betook himſelf to the place of his former abode, notwithſtanding temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there; and ſo made it his work to watch againſt evil deſires, by exerciſing ſelf-denial, and not by deſerting his place and ſtation.</p>
                     <p>4. By Exemplary Caution. The wrathful Diſpenſations of <hi>Providence</hi> are Warning-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions. The Lord is terrible in his doings, to the end he may not be further terrible. We have the doctrine aſſerted once and again; <hi>God is terrible in his works or doings towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men,</hi> Pſal. 66. 3, 5. We have alſo the uſe of this doctrine, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Let not the rebellious exalt themſelves. Selah. Remember Lot's Wife,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17 32. <hi>God ſpared not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>the old world, but ſaved Noah the eighth perſon, a preacher of righteouſneſs, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; and turning the Cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them examples unto thoſe that ſhould after live ungodly,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>5. By way of Prohibition. There is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prohibition from the word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2 17. and there is a phyſical or natural one, when there is an impediment more or leſs in the way, as Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, which forbid an acceſs to the Tree of Life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. There is a prohibition which is
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:101303:275"/> mixt, partly moral, and partly otherwiſe. So <hi>Balaam,</hi> his way was perverſe, and withal the Angel oppoſed in the way of his journey, <hi>Num.</hi> 22. 32. Now here it muſt be remembred, That every ſeeming-prohibition of <hi>Providence,</hi> doth not by and by beſpeak the evil of a man's way. <hi>Jacob</hi> met with an <hi>Eſau</hi> coming forth armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; he was not prohibited from, but warranted a returning into his Countrey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 5. However, where a man meets with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> as checking a man's courſes, eſpecially if a ſignal check, or ſeries and chain of checks, there is great reaſon to conſider of a man's ways, to deſiſt from what appears to be ſinful, and to give God the glory of ſuch a checking-diſpenſation, which hath its double conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (1.) As it looks with a ſtern and full countenance on the ſubſtance, matter, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing about which a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant: ſo in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s caſe, when he play'd the part of a Runagate from his God; that <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi>-voyage the very Heavens frown on, and leave not frowing till the Ship is unloaded of its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving burden, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 15. (2.) As it looks on the circumſtances attending the action. An inſtance for this in <hi>David</hi>'s good intention to bring again the Ark; the work was good and laudable, yet a checking-Providence there is in the Lord's ſmiting <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah;</hi> and that checking-Providence reſpects the omiſſion of a weighty circumſtance, or an innovation in bringing up the Ark; for ſo it's ſaid to the chief of the fathers of the <hi>Levites: For becauſe ye did it not at the firſt, the Lord our God made a breach upon</hi>
                        <pb n="535" facs="tcp:101303:275"/> 
                        <hi>us, for that we ſought him not after the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> 1 Chron. 15. 13. Thus, whether <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> be prohibitive abſolutely as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or limitedly as to ſome circumſtance or other; it concerns man, under ſuch frowning-aſpects of <hi>Providence,</hi> to take a ſurvey, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to demean himſelf.</p>
                     <p>6. By way of Encouragement. There are encouraging Providences to duty. Theſe may reſpect, (1.) Doing-work, which may be more common or ſpecial. When God calls to more than ordinary work, he vouchſafeth more than ordinary encouragement. So it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 4. 2, to 9 <hi>Joſhua</hi> had an encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Viſion by <hi>Jericho;</hi> Joſh. 5. 13. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with ſigns following,</hi> Mark 16. 20. (2.) Suffering-work. Much of God's Providence there is by way of preparation and corroboration to be obſerved: ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. there is fore-warning given, and conſequently a fore-arming.</p>
                     <p>7. By way of Supportation and Conſolation under Difficulties, Diſtreſſes, Afflictions. There are ſupporting-conſolations, or conſolatory-ſupportations. This bread is broken to the ſons and daughters of ſorrows. The Supports and Conſolations are of two ſorts (if I may ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them), (1.) <hi>Internal</hi> The Lord feaſts his children, whilſt wicked ones would ſtarve them, ruin them. The Father of Spirits makes out Himſelf to their ſpirits. Chriſt hath his Banqueting-houſe for thoſe of His who are without a certain habitation, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 4. with
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:101303:276"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 11. When men frown, God ſmiles. A <hi>joy</hi> there is, <hi>and no one taketh it from them,</hi> John 16. 22. It is reported of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Landſgrave,</hi> who was confined by the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, That being asked, What ſupported him, and cheered him in that condition? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſaying, <hi>I feel the divine comforts of the Martyrs.</hi> But, (2.) There are Supports and Comforts <hi>External;</hi> as when the Lord in his Providence doth iſſue matters comfortably for them. So in the caſe of enemies, when God works, and ſo works, even to the amazement of wicked ones, ſo as they may be ready to ſay to Providence, as the Devils to Chriſt, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> Mat. 8. 29. and this is that which is implied in <hi>David</hi>'s prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 17. <hi>Shew a token for good, that they which hate me, may ſee it, and be aſhamed, becauſe thou, Lord, haſt holpen me, and comforted me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. By way of Direction. There are the leadings of Providence; but theſe are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Word, not repugnant to it. The Word is the Rule ruling; Providence, as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, is the Rule ruled. As therefore the Rule of the Word is partly through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome on the one hand, and partly through the perverſneſs of others on the other hand, too much neglected, and diſregarded: ſo in like ſort the light of Providence, partly through the weak apprehenſion of ſome, and the perverſe perception of others, is little heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it ought to be. We do not find that the chief Prieſts and Scribes did make enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, though they were alarumed by the
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:101303:276"/> Wiſe-men's coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo to have done; they, being conſulted by <hi>Herod,</hi> point out the way to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to the Wiſe-men; who as they were awakened by the Starr they ſaw in the Eaſt; ſo they are led by a <hi>Providence</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> there they have light from the Sacred Oracle, where Chriſt was to be born; and after, going to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they have a ſight of the Starr again which they ſaw in the Eaſt. The leading of them by the Starr, had its ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable aſpect to, and with, the Sacred Oracle, reſolving where Chriſt ſhould be born. And though the Lord do not now-a-days provide Starrs to guide men in their ordinary Affairs; yet there are the becks, indigitations, the twinkling-rays of <hi>Providence</hi> in matters to be heeded for direction. I could enlarge here on this Head; but becauſe this Treatiſe ſwells, it may ſuffice to have pointed at the pointings of <hi>Providence,</hi> as holding a correſpondence with the Word, which is the Chriſtian-man's Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory for his Affairs and Concernments.</p>

                     <p>6. KEEP up an holy Communion with God in his Diſpenſations. If <hi>Providence</hi> have a tongue to ſpeak, and that divers ways, as hath been ſhewed in the fore-going Section; then men ſhould have an ear to hear: So had <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as he declares to <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10. 33. It's the higheſt piece of incivility, to ſlight the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:101303:277"/> Viſits and Letters of <hi>Providence.</hi> As it is man's wiſdom to enquire into the ends of God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; ſo it is his folly to go no farther than enquiry. An holy conformity ſhould be the reſult or iſſue of enquiry. To know <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> to be the End of God in a Diſpenſation, and yet to ſtand a-loof from a conformity to, or compliance with ſuch an End, is double iniquity. Let it be thy care then, O man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, ſeriouſly to conſider what Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand or Meſſage this or that Diſpenſation hath to thy ſoul; hear it awfully, and obey it fully; ſo ſhall God have the glory of his <hi>Providence,</hi> and thy Soul the comfort of thy ſo-performed a duty.</p>

                     <p>7. LOOK after encreaſe of Grace, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the better bearing of Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſpenſations. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth on the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and in them on others, To <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> Eph. 6. 10. And good reaſon is there to mind this: for weak Bottles are not fit for the new and ſtrong Wine of Divine Diſpenſations. A painted man bears not a real Burden; and a real Man-child can better hold a Rattle in his hand, than carry a Faggot on his back. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, as well as reality of Grace, is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's concernment; and this appears, if an eye be had, (1.) To the eminency or height of
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:101303:277"/> a Divine Diſpenſation. There is ſometimes an <hi>Iſaac</hi>-trial, and a man had need of an <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s faith. A <hi>Goliah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> difficulty calls for the courage and ſpirit of a <hi>David.</hi> Conſumptive-lungs have an hard task to follow a <hi>Providence</hi> up the hill. (2.) To the variety of Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Proſperity and Adverſity do often take their turns. It's no eaſie matter to manage wiſely variety of conditions. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>the ſecret of God on his tabernacle,</hi> Job 29. 4. and again, <hi>He</hi> (God) <hi>hath looſed my cord, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me,</hi> Job 30. 11. He hath need of a <hi>Job</hi>'s graces, who may take a <hi>Job</hi> by the hand in point of various diſpenſations. (3.) To the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs or unexpectedneſs of a Diſpenſation. Weak bodies are not ſo capacitated to bear ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den changes in Diet, Air, Apparel, as thoſe that be ſtrong and vigorous. A ſudden Affliction may preſs a man too low; and an unexpected Mercy may l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He had need of good eyes, and ſtrong brains, who is taken out of a dark Dungeon, and ſet on the top of a Pyramid or high Tower. <hi>Jonah</hi> had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected guord; and that which <hi>came up in a night, periſhed in a night,</hi> Jonah 4. 10. How is he tranſported beyond ſobriety under the guord-diſpenſation! He who was exceeding glad, was exceeding angry; his exceſſive joy is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with inordinate ſorrow and diſcontent of heart. Let then the conſideration of the height, variety, ſuddenneſs, of Providential Diſpenſations, be an excitement to look after an encreaſe of grace; the exerciſe of grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and a further encreaſe of grace exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

                     <p>LASTLY, Live holily and thankfully the Providential Diſpenſations which have concentred or met in thy Perſon, Family, or Relations. To this end conſider the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Incentives:</p>
                     <p>1. With what patheticalneſs, or holy ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs is the living of <hi>Providences</hi> preſſed in Scripture? See <hi>Deut</hi> 8. 6. with the precedent verſes: <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 14. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>2. The Law of Ingenuity requireth holineſs and thankfulneſs for what God hath done in his <hi>Providence</hi> for men. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to God) <hi>haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling: I will walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in the land of the living,</hi> Pſal. 116. 8, 9. See <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75.</p>
                     <p>3. Sin otherwiſe is greatly aggravated. The Lord may ſay for neglect of a reſponſable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards his Diſpenſations, as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Nabal, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hath in the wilderneſs,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 21. It is made an aggravation of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s ſin, that <hi>he rendred not again according to the benefit done</hi>

                        <hi>unto him: for his heart was lifted up,</hi> 2 Chron. 32. 25.</p>
                     <p>4. The thankful and holy living of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> may invite the God of <hi>Providence</hi> to do more for perſons. <hi>If that had been too little for thee</hi> (ſaith God by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I would moreover have given unto thee</hi> ſuch and ſuch things, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 8. God hath a rich treaſure of kindneſs; he will not be a barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe who are a <hi>Carmel</hi> for holy fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>I conclude all with that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. <hi>Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
